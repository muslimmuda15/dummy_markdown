4[th] Asia Pacific Silver Economy
Business Opportunities Report
2020 - 2025 Edition


## Foreword

Ageing is the new black and the baby boomer (born
between 1944 and 1964) population is rapidly
emerging as the new Cool Ager demographic. We
are only just awakening to the opportunities driven by
1.2 billion seniors in Asia Pacific. The world of ageing
is no longer one depicted by just images of frailty,
grey hair and weaknesses, instead, the 60+
population in overthrowing all preconceive notions of
what old looks and feels like, what seniors want and
what the definition of old is. Today’s 60+ generation
is ageing differently from previous generations. Baby
boomers are typically are a generation that worked
hard, saved well, self-sufficient and drove change.
They are typically better educated, more
independent, healthier and travelled more than
previous generations. As they age, their attitudes,
behaviours, wants, likes and dislikes will determine
the success or failure of businesses that want to
capture a piece of this lucrative US$4.56 trillion silver
market opportunity.

In Asia, traditional notions of filial piety where parents
and children live together in multi-generation houses
are undergoing a transformative change. Whilst baby
boomer parents may choose to live and care for their
parents, they do not envision their children doing the
same. They are empowered, vibrant, active,
engaged, making their own decisions about where
they want to live, how they want to spend their money
and how they plan to age as they get frail, and even
how they want to leave this world with advance care
planning and early estate planning. Having had the
responsibility of caring for their parents, top of mind
for baby boomers is how to avoid being a burden to
their children and families as they age. There are
two major market segments to capture: the rising
middle to higher income baby boomers and the high
net worth baby boomers. The high expectations for
higher standards of living by baby boomers extends
beyond healthcare, overlapping into every sector of
our economy: Real estate, tourism, transportation,
wellness, beauty, food, technology and finance.


The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts the
60+ population will nearly double by 2050 from 12
percent to 22 percent. Globally, brands from the
United States to Japan to Europe, and now Asia, are
actively trailblazing silver demographic opportunities
with product line extensions, personalisation
strategies, technology innovations and niche sector
marketing. According to research highlighted by the
International Longevity Centre United Kingdom,
happiness and age is possibly co-related, and one’s
happiness levels could increase with age. The trend
is U-shaped with peaks at youth, moderate
happiness in the years from 20s to 40s, rising again
to a new peak at 74 years old. We see this as a
positive indication of people ageing with more
financial and family commitment freedom in later
years. The silver economy potential will continue to
bring rising awareness to the business of ageing for
global brands and marketers seeking new market
opportunities.

4[th] Asia Pacific Silver Economy
Business Opportunities Report
2020 - 2025 Edition


## Executive summary

In line with previous Ageing Asia’s published Asia
Pacific Silver Economy Business Opportunities
Report 2013 and 2015, and the view taken by United
Nations in their World Population Ageing 2017 report,
ageing population defined in this report refers to
persons aged 60 years and above.

In the 3rd Asia Pacific Silver Economy Business
Opportunities Report 2015, we performed projection
of the market outlook up to 2020 with the market
potential value projected to be US$3.3 trillion, and the
ageing population to increase to 500 million across
the 15 countries covered in the report. In this report,
we focused on the market potential and market size,
with regards to the ageing population in 2025, with
some glimpse of further projections up to 2030 and
2040 for certain data analysed.

Leveraging on the same metrics used in the 2015
report, we will use Household Savings as an
indication of the population’s capacity to spend
outside of their current consumption expenses.

Based on the data compiled from World Bank - World
Development Data, International Monetary Fund
(“IMF”) – World Economic Outlook Update, June
2020, Asian Development Bank - Asian Development
Outlook and further analysis performed by Ageing
Asia team, this report presents the forecasted ageing
market value in 2025 for each country, with analysis
and tabulation for the Silver Economy Index 2020.

Based on the latest data retrieved from World Bank
population projections, the ageing population across
the 15 countries for 2020 is adjusted to 524 million,
and in 2025 the ageing population will increase by
18.3% to 620 million and up to 730 million by 2030.
By 2025, there would be a total of nine Asia Pacific
countries that would be considered as super-aged
nation, namely Japan (35.8%), Hong Kong (30.2%),


Republic of Korea (28.0%), Taiwan (27.1%),
Singapore (25.8%), New Zealand (24.6%), Australia
(23.4%), Thailand (23.1%) and China (20.6%).

The youngest baby boomer will be 60 years old in
2024, and they would be part of the ageing
population. Baby boomer’s generation remains as the
key target market segment for the next 10-20 years,
and as they age. Their expectations and demand for
goods and services to support their lifestyle and
healthcare needs as they age, would be different
from the previous generations, and this group would
be more willing to spend to age well.

Business opportunities to penetrate the ageing
population are wide ranging from healthcare services
or related products, retirement homes/ villages,
residential care and across all the sectors including
lifestyle services.

Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic and the
governments implementation on movement and
social contact restrictions, technology has emerged
as a key tool for communication and daily living. This
has resulted to seniors adapting to new technologies
to stay connected with family and friends. These
business opportunities are further discussed in later
section of the report - Top 10 Asia Pacific Silver
Economy Trends.

As the society ages, other than chronic diseases,
age-related health issues such as frailty, incontinence
and dementia, would impact seniors’ quality of life.
Globally, one of the key health issues impacting the
ageing population, and partly due to longer life
expectancy is the increasing number of persons living
with dementia.

As Asia Pacific region being one of the biggest,
representing nearly 60% of the world’s total

## Executive summary

population at 4.3 billion, it is projected that the impact
on the region will be one of the largest. There is an
estimated 23 million people living with dementia in
the region and the biggest increase in numbers
across the globe, based on ageing population
demographic.

The total estimated cost of dementia worldwide is
over US$1 trillion in 2020, and this number can be
expected to double by 2030. The number of people
living with dementia will increase from 50 million in

In the last five years, governments around the world
have kickstarted or accelerated their efforts to plan
and implement new initiatives and services, including
building dementia-friendly communities, to support
persons living with dementia.

In June 2020, Alzheimer’s Disease International
published their latest report – From Plan to Impact III
which provides an overview of the current national
responses to dementia around the world, based on
their consultation with each country’s representatives
and the status updates received from the countries.

The report represents an up-to-date and holistic view


2020, 82 million in 2030 and ultimately 152 million in
2050 globally.

Based on the Alzheimer’s Disease International World Alzheimer Report 2015 - The Global Impact of
Dementia, it is estimated that there would be 35.5
million persons living with dementia by 2030, across
the 15 Asia Pacific countries covered in this report.
This accounts to 4% - 10% of the ageing population
in these countries, and by 2050 the number will
increase to 62.4 million persons.

of progress towards the targets of the WHO Global
plan and presents the global view of the current
policy landscape of a dementia plan. The diagram on
the next page shows the different stages of the
dementia plans development and adoption by each
government.

Most of the Asia Pacific countries’ governments are
still in the strategy development stage (Stage 2 and
3) with mix progress, while Indonesia, Taiwan,
Singapore, Japan and Republic of Korea have
achieved stage 5 with their dementia plans fully
adopted.

## Executive summary

There is an urgent need for the rest of the Asia
Pacific countries’ governments to accelerate their
efforts to develop and implement the dementia plans,
in order to support the 35 million persons living with
dementia by 2030.

Persons living with dementia will generally progress
through the three stages of dementia, i.e. predementia, mild to moderate and severe, and at each
stage, the person will require different level of care.
At the mild stage, the person is just beginning to feel
the onset of dementia symptoms and may be able to
functional almost like a normal person, and the
individual will progress slowly to moderate and finally
severe stage where 24 hours care will be required.

Opportunities for businesses to develop innovative
products and services to cater to the different stages
of persons living with dementia and their caregivers,
such as cognitive training development programmes
and exercise programmes to minimise the risk of
dementia or delay the onset of dementia, to aged
care and residential care services to support patients
at moderate to severe stages.

There has been an increased focus on fun
rehabilitation products that encourage the
engagement of seniors, particularly persons with
dementia on both cognitive and functional training, in
hope to delay the progression of the disease. Such
products include Bunne swing guitar, music therapy,

## Executive summary

their daily consumption needs. Based on this
assumption and a percentage to the ageing
population, the estimated ageing market potential
value for 2025 will increase by 43% to US$4.56
trillion from US$3.2 trillion projected for 2020.

China has recorded the highest increase in the
market potential value of US$977 billion and an
increase of 60% from 2020 to 2025. China remains
as the single biggest economy within Asia Pacific,
taking up 57% of the total ageing market potential in
Asia Pacific for 2025.

Japan being the super-aged country with 35.8%
population aged 60 and above, is the second largest
ageing market in Asia Pacific, that accounts to
US$884 billion and 19.3% of the ageing market
potential in Asia Pacific.

The market outlook for the ageing market remains
positive, even in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic,
with majority of the industry players believe that the
impact of the pandemic will be short-lived and the
market will pick up and adapt to the new norm of
aged care services and ageing technologies.

For the Ageing Asia Silver Economy Index 2020, we
have refined the methodology and the approach in
our projection of ageing market potential of each
country and overall landscape of the Asia Pacific
ageing business opportunities.

The key drivers of the index remain the same:

   - Market size of the ageing population – the
number of seniors within a market is one of


the key market entrant determinants. The
market size plays a bigger role in the
consideration, as compared to the percentage
of an ageing population within a country. In
view of this, we have increased the weightage
for market size and reduced the ageing
population percentage, while maintaining the
overall ageing population weightage at 15%

   - Financial Capacity – the wealth of the
residents and the capacity to purchase and
consume other products and services outside
of household consumption expenditure, either
by the seniors themselves or by their children.

   - Life Expectancy – this factor remains as the
one of key determinants in the longevity of a
demand for goods and services.

   - Retirement funds – in relation to financial
capacity, we have added in mandatory
retirement savings and government healthcare
support as a new indicator of the retirement
living financial burden.

Based on our research, we found that in some
countries, seniors face financial crunch due to poor
financial planning and high healthcare costs. In view
of this, we have added in retirement living financial
burden indicator based on two key factors, namely
mandatory retirement saving plan implemented within
each country (minimum 35 years of savings) and the
level of healthcare financial support provided by the
government for their senior citizens.

_Source: Ageing Asia Calculations based on World Bank, World Development Indicators; IMF, World Economic Outlook Update; Asian_
_Development Bank, Asian Development Outlook and United Nations. Life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined (years) - 2025_


Based on the analysis on the key drivers and to
generate Ageing Asia Silver Economy Index 2020,
Singapore retains its top position for the second year
running while Australia maintains its third position.

Japan jumped from the sixth position to second spot,
largely due to improved household savings per capita
forecasted in 2025 in comparison to other developed
countries. Other factors such as their ageing
population size and longer life expectancy have
pushed them to be one of the top countries.

Hong Kong S.A.R has dropped by two positions from
second to fourth position, while Republic of Korea
and New Zealand has dropped by one position to be
fifth and sixth position respectively.


In our Silver Economy Index analysis, we noted the
following:

  - The top five countries are super-aged nations
with more than 20% ageing population,
although the market size may not be the
largest when compared to the rest of the Asia
Pacific countries.

  - GDP per capita and household savings have
increased from 2020 to 2025 and Japan has
the highest increment which has led the push
to a higher ranking as compared to 2015
report. Developed countries remain as a
target market due to its capacity to purchase
goods and services, in addition to their
receptiveness to exploring new products and
services.

of the countries’ life expectancy have increased
between 0.5 – 1 year, except for Vietnam which has
reduced by 0.94 years. Australia, Hong Kong SAR,
Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand and
Singapore remains as the top six countries with the
highest life expectancy within the Asia Pacific region,
with life expectancy of 84 years and above.

Although the life expectancy rate is higher for most of
the countries, however, when compared to the
Healthy Life Expectancy years, i.e. the average
number of years of good health, we noted that
majority of the developed / affluent countries have


recorded decreased quality of life, i.e. increased
years of poor or sub-health compared the results
reported in our 2015 report, such as Australia, Hong
Kong S.A.R and Japan.

China, Republic of Korea and Singapore are the few
developed countries that have recorded significant
improvements in poor health expectancy, between
2.5 – 3.5 years, while Myanmar and Vietnam
recorded the highest improvement, at 7.9 years and
5.4 years respectively.

countries is ten years, with the longest poor health
years at 14 years for Hong Kong S.A.R, while
Singapore recorded the shortest poor health years at
7.49 year and the highest healthy life expectancy at
76.2 years.

Based on the healthy life expectancy and number of
poor health years for the average population of each
country, different range of products and services
required to cater for active agers or the pre-frail and
frail seniors.

The continuum of care required during poor health
years can range from general medical care for early
onset of chronic disease management to multiple
chronic disease management, age-related health
issues e.g. limited mobility, falls or physical injuries,
frailty and dementia that would lead to requiring 24
hours residential care with further deterioration of
health.

The products and services catering for later half of
the poor health years would focus towards healthcare
services, home care and residential care facilities
and services.

A wider range of product and services can be
provided to healthy individuals and those living with


illness, e.g., early onset of chronic disease, to
support active ageing and preventive health
management, through wellness programmes,
nutritional pharmaceuticals, aesthetics medicine,
lifestyle goods and services and retirement villages
or independent living housing options.

As evidenced from the market survey results,
industry respondents have opined that sports and
wellness and travel and tourism are the upcoming
two sectors and may have the highest growth
potential within the ageing market, after healthcare
and rehabilitation. Seniors residential housing and
care facilities remain as the most immediate ageing
market opportunity, which is undeniable, in view of
the shortages of nursing home beds in each country.

## Outlook in Asia Pacific Ageing Market 2020 – 2025


The survey was sent out to over 200 industry leaders
in the ageing market sector, on their outlook for the
Asia Pacific ageing market, the market potential for
existing and emerging products and services catered
for the ageing population and government initiatives
in support the silver market. The survey also features
these industry leaders and on their outlook on
COVID-19.

Based on the respondents input to the survey, we
noted the following key findings:

   - The economic boom for the ageing market is
expected to happen within the next ten years,
i.e. from 2020 – 2030, similar to 2015 report. A
total of 50% of the respondents expect the
boom to happen between 2025 – 2030, as
compared to 18% reported in the 2015 report.

   - A number of respondents generally feel that
the aged care sector will slow down due to the
impact of COVID-19 globally, however, most
are positive that the impact is limited and the
growth within the ageing market will continue.

   - In line with our 2015 report, respondents
continue to view Asia Pacific as the largest
economic potential for the ageing market, of
which China, Singapore and Japan are top
three countries with the biggest economic
potential for businesses looking to access the
ageing market.

   - Middle-income seniors remains as the target
market segment for the ageing business,
which is in line with the baby boomer
generation that is affluent and well-educated.
It is interesting to note that some respondents
are beginning to see lower-income seniors as
a potential market segment, increased from


2% reported in 2015 to 11% in this report.

 - Senior housing with services (24 hours
residential care with facilities, assisted living
facilities and senior housing communities Independent Living), home care services and
capability development/ manpower training
remain as the top three most immediate
ageing market opportunity, similar to our
findings reported in our 2015 report.

 - Ageing technologies, as new sector added to
the list on ageing market opportunities, has
taken the spot as one of the top most
immediate ageing market opportunity. Due to
the global pandemic crisis, technology driven
products and services have been wellreceived in the aged care sector. This
demonstrates a mindset shift towards
embracing technology within this sector.

 - Sports and Wellness and Travel and Tourism
sectors have climbed to be the top four
sectors expected to have the biggest growth
potential by 2025. The have moved up from
their sixth and seventh placing respectively in
the 2015 report, to third and fourth placing in
this report. Healthcare and rehabilitation
remain as the top two sectors with the biggest
growth potential within the ageing market in
Asia Pacific.

 - The top five areas that would improve the
quality of ageing in Asia Pacific did not shift
significantly as compared to 2015 report.
Creating integrated communities to enable
ageing-in-place remains as the key area
towards enhancing the quality of ageing,
followed by providing holistic and affordable
healthcare and aged care services.

## Outlook in Asia Pacific Ageing Market 2020 – 2025


The section below is our analysis on the responses
received for the survey questions, and the findings
therein. We have also incorporated comparative
analysis for the questions that have similar aspects to
the survey conducted in our 2015 Silver Report.

**How do you view the impact of the Coronarvirus**
**(COVID-19) on the growth of the silver economy**
**in Asia Pacific from 2020 - 2025?**

The main concern that resonates across our
respondents is the vulnerability of seniors, especially
those who are living with co-morbidity. COVID-19 is
seen to be deadlier to the ageing population and
serves as a challenge – and with social distancing
measures in place, loneliness and social isolation are
also seen to be rising problems that need to be
addressed. A handful of respondents opined that the
health and wellness sector will pick up momentum
during the pandemic.

A large group of respondents opined that IT would be
the greatest business opportunity for the aged care
sector, emerging from this pandemic. As social
events and visits are getting restricted, the aged care
sector would have to turn to tele-health, e-commerce,
and virtual visits. As a relatively untapped sector in
the ageing market, the growth potential will be
considerable.

Some respondents felt that the current situation will
impact the ageing market economically, especially in
2020, with non-essential projects and activities
almost coming to a complete halt, the sector’s growth
will be severely impacted. Additionally, a number of
respondents remarked that as the global economy
spirals, the government funds originally allocated to
aged care policies and plans would be shifted


elsewhere to support the critical economies.

A majority of respondents felt that the impact would
only be short-lived and in the long run, the growth of
the aged care sector would continue as long as a
vaccine is found or if the virus is contained.
Conversely, several respondents feel that it is still too
early to tell. Ultimately, respondents’ outlook are
hopeful that the impact would be limited, where the
aged care sector would slow down but is expected to
pick up again, in the near future.

**What is your outlook on the future of ageing in**
**2025?**

The general sentiment from the respondents indicate
a positive outlook for the ageing market with various
areas for business to offer, including collaboration
with governments to deliver the range of services and
products to the ageing population.

The key focus continue to be directed towards
delivering residential care to meet the demands for
frail seniors, while home care and other solutions to
support ageing-in-place are seen as areas for
business to develop, along with wellness and
preventive health solutions and ageing technologies.

Most respondents believe that there would be
continuous, if not accelerated growth across all
sectors in the ageing market, within the next ten

## Outlook in Asia Pacific Ageing Market 2020 – 2025


**Do you think Asia Pacific Governments are**
**proactive in their policies and initiatives in**
**addressing the rising needs of an ageing**
**population?**

55% of respondents find that Asia Pacific
Governments are proactive in their policies, whereas
the other 45% of the respondents believe that the
governments can play a more major part in helping to
address the rising needs of the ageing population.


Although the findings are not skewed towards one
side or the other, it is interesting to note that in our
previous 2015 report on the same question, the
respondents were split equally at 50%.

With a small shift in perception, it can be inferred that
although the government has been credited for being
more proactive in helping the ageing population in the
last five years, much more can be done within each
country.

**most proactive?**

From the list of 15 countries covered in this report, it
is interesting to note that the governments that are
considered as most proactive are the countries that
are nearer to a super-aged population. It is not
surprising that there would be greater emphasis on


government involvement when the reality of an aged
population starts to set in. It is important for countries
that have yet to become an ageing population to
prepare and leverage on the lessons learnt and
action taken from these proactive countries to
mitigate the risks of an aged population and social
and economic impact.

Government policies and new initiatives are
constantly evolving to meet the needs of the ageing
population, and these needs and expectations shift a
little with each generation of seniors. The baby
boomers are more independent, well-educated and it
is timely that government grants are moving towards
a more flexible use of the funding to provide seniors
with the option to choose their preferred aged care
facilities and services.

**What is the most impactful government initiative /**
**policy implemented in your country that will**
**support the needs of an ageing population over**
**the next five years?**

Compared to our 2015 report, there have been some
new key initiatives. These include active ageing
policies, senior employment policies and the
implementation of national dementia strategies.
The key themes noted across the responses
received:

   - Higher funding allocation for the aged
healthcare sector, in the form of aged care
subsidies, tax exemption for medical


insurance or construction/operational grants.

- Introduction or revision of nursing care
requirements and minimum quality of care to
be provided to the general population.

- Introduction or revision in the means testing
for health and aged care services, to provide
affordability and an array of choices for the
middle/lower class.

- Encouraging the growth of public-private
partnership across sectors to provide better
care that is more holistic.

- Introduction or revision of senior employment
policies, with more support for seniors
employees and employers that continues to
retain an ageing workforce.

- Introduction or revision of national dementia
framework to address the needs of people
living with dementia and support them better.

   - Introduction of active ageing policies to
promote intergenerational bonding, lifelong
learning and to help address social isolation.

Based on our research, we have noted that in the last
five years, the governments across Asia Pacific have
conducted reviews to determine the effectiveness of
the existing and new policies, and some have
enhanced these policies to meet the changing needs
of the aged care sector. Some initiatives are
implemented in a phased approach to assess
effectiveness before moving to the next phase.

**How can we encourage more private sector**
**participation in growing the ageing market?**

Majority of respondents (69%) felt that Public Private
Partnerships (PPP) are the most effective method in


encouraging private sector participation in the ageing
sector. Much similar to the report in 2015, the
consensus has not changed, where the governments
should increase collaboration with the private sector.

This could include but not limited to build-own lease
models, subsidies, tax rebates and welfare benefits.
Private sectors usually favour schemes or policies
that can help alleviate the huge costs that are
involved in a start-up. This helps to greatly reduce
the risks involved when venturing into a new market,
making the investment more attractive.

Some of the other considerations from respondents
include: Consumer directed welfare policy shifts,
government funding for capital costs and pooling of
senior customers into a shared database.

**Which region has the biggest economic potential**
**for businesses looking to access the ageing**
**market?**

Current mature markets such as Japan, United
States of Americas and Europe have strong
economic potential for the ageing market. However,
75% of the respondents believe that Asia Pacific
(excluding Japan) is where the businesses should be
focusing, i.e. the highest economic potential.

As more Asia Pacific countries move towards and
ageing or super-aged population, business
opportunities to support these seniors are wide

ranging. The seniors, particularly baby boomers who
are more affluent and more aware of products and
services that can be built or offered within Asia
Pacific, as observed from Japan, USA or Europe
market.

The Asia Pacific ageing market has high growth
potential and wide spectrum of business
opportunities, where a range of products and
services can be offered to support holistic wellbeing
and continuum of care for seniors. The changing
needs of seniors is an interesting trend to watch for
business to ensure they remain relevant to meet the
expectations of the ageing population.

**Which country / countries in Asia Pacific has one**
**of the biggest economic potential for businesses**
**looking to access the ageing market?**

As a follow on to the respondents who had indicated
Asia Pacific as the region with the biggest economic
potential, they were asked to select the top three Asia
Pacific countries amongst the 15 countries covered in
this report.

79% of these respondents indicated that China as
one of the top three Asia Pacific countries, followed
by Singapore (44%) and Japan (36%). China
emerged as a significant favourite amongst the
respondents, primarily due to the size of their ageing
population and is one of the fastest growing
economies in the last 20 - 30 years. Based on World
Bank data, there are 167 million seniors aged 65 and
above in 2020 (12% of the total population) and is
projected increase to 239 million (17%) in 2030 and


348 million (26%) by 2050.

China’s large population has been viewed as a
potential market for various industries, therefore, it is
not surprising too, with their ageing population
moving towards to super aged by 2040 and the sheer
size of their ageing population, respondents view
China as the biggest economic potential for business
to access the ageing market within Asia Pacific, and
based on our analysis the ageing market potential for
China in 2025 is US$2.61 trillion, accounting to 57%
of the total market potential in Asia Pacific.

However, based on our Silver Economy Index
analysis that takes into account the potential
purchasing value of each individual in the country, i.e.
the GDP per capita and Household Savings per

th

capita, China is ranked 8 as these figures are much

lower than most of the affluent Asia Pacific countries.

**When do you think the ageing market economic**
**boom will happen in Asia Pacific (Excluding**
**Japan)?**

Based on the survey findings, 50% of the
respondents believe that the silver economy will
experience the economic boom between 2025 –
2030, while close to 36% of the respondents believe
that it will happen, within the next five years, i.e.
between 2020 - 2025.

The ageing market is expected to boom in the next
ten years, particularly in the later half when the
youngest baby boomer will be 60 years old in 2024
and will join the ageing population. Baby boomers
continue to be the target market segment and this
group will be driving the market landscape for the
next ten years and more.


In comparison to 2015 report, 81% of the
respondents expected the ageing market economic
boom to happen between 2015 – 2025, and more
significantly between 2020 - 2025 (52% of the
respondents) which seem to indicate the trend of
respondents expect the economic boom to happen
within next five to ten years, based on the point-intime market outlook.

A point to note, it is forecasted that by 2025, Hong
Kong S.A.R, Republic of Korea and Taiwan would
become super-aged nations (whereby 1 in 5 is aged
65 and above) and by 2030, Singapore, New Zealand
and Australia would join these countries as super
aged nations too. It would be interesting to watch the
development and ramp up of the ageing market
landscape in the coming ten years, but it would be
more exhilarating for the businesses to be part of the
shapers of the landscape.

**What are the top five areas that will improve the**
**quality of ageing for Asia Pacific?**

Based on our survey findings, respondents have
rated the top 5 areas that will improve the quality of
ageing for Asia Pacific as follow:

   - Creating integrated communities to enable
ageing-in-place (74%)

   - Providing holistic and affordable healthcare
and aged care services (67%)

   - Incentives to encourage private sector
investments and innovations in products and
services for older adults (57%)



   - Encouraging preventive health and wellness
programmes/services (55%)

   - Universal health insurance coverage for older
adults (47%)

Creating integrated communities to enable ageing-inplace is ranked as the most important aspect, much
in line with sentiment across Asia Pacific, where
seniors prefer to age-in-place instead of relocating to
a retirement home or a nursing home. Relocation to a
new residential place is considered stressful to the
seniors, not only from the physical (manual) chore of
packing and unpacking their home, but also the
financial considerations and access to their family
and friends.

Comparing the results with the survey done in the
2015 report, the top five areas are largely similar,
with switch between universal health insurance
coverage and creating a dementia friendly
community. With an increasing ageing population
and increasing healthcare cost, coupled with more
discerning and educated seniors, universal insurance
policies designed for this group will provide the
additional security and peace of mind for the seniors.

With life expectancy age improving each year and
forecast of people living past 100 years old,
traditional insurance coverage and duration should
be reviewed to cater for the changing needs and
lifestyle of the ageing population.

Correspondingly, the growing ageing population
would also mean an increased demand for


healthcare and aged care services, including
dementia care services. In line with our research for
the 15 Asia Pacific countries, most countries are
prepared to meet this growing demand, where more
products, services and facilities need to be
established.

**Which of the following sectors outside of elderly**
**services have the highest and lowest growth**
**potential in Asia Pacific's ageing market by 2025?**

For this question, we have removed Senior Housing
and Assistive Living Technologies & Wearable
Device as compared to our 2015 report, to be sector
specific and to facilitate the respondent to think
beyond senior housing for market opportunities by
2025. Senior Housing is a favourite and undeniable a
sector that both government and private sectors are

working towards fulfilling the demand, whilst Ageing
Technologies is a tool/ system would be fulfilled
across all the sectors.

Majority of the respondents (80%) has selected
healthcare as the top sector with the biggest growth
potential. In our previous 2015 report on the same
question, healthcare was selected as the sector with
the biggest growth too.

With a growing number of seniors and longer life
expectancy age, the old-old of the ageing population
will undoubtedly increase, which will lead to higher
demand for healthcare services.

An ageing society also denotes an increase in the


prevalence of age-related conditions such as frailty
and dementia. As such, the growth potential in the
healthcare sector is immense.

nd

Rehabilitation is ranked at 2 place at 53%, followed

by Sports & Wellness at 47% and Travel and
Tourism at 46%. As observed in the market and
overall behaviour of baby boomers, they are more
concerned about their health and well-being,
therefore preventive health and active ageing is seen
as their approach towards an independent and
dignified ageing.

We noted a shift in the mindset of the respondents,
where Sport and Wellness was ranked as the top two
for the lowest growth potential category in our 2015

report, however, current survey results, Sports and
Wellness is now ranked at the top 3 in highest growth
potential category. Meanwhile, Travel and Tourism
has climbed from seventh in 2015 report to fourth
placing in the current survey results.

It is undeniable that the need for rehabilitation and
active ageing will continue to increase, to mitigate
healthcare issues that may arise with the ageing
population. Although such services/ industries are
one of the key focus in certain countries and within
the governments budget to implement related
initiatives, the growth potential remains high in view
of the increasing number of the ageing population.
More of such services/industries will be required in


time to cater for this large population, either in
preventive health management or for health related
treatments.

**Which area presents the most immediate ageing**
**market opportunity?**

In the past 2015 report, there were 7 options that
presents the most immediate ageing market
opportunity. In this edition, to make it more specific
and targeted, we have expanded Senior Housing with
Services (which was ranked in second placing, with
23% in the 2015 report) to specific categories:

   - Residential Care Facilities (24 hours) – now
ranked at the top at 16%,

i i 25

4[th] Asia Pacific Silver Economy
Business Opportunities Report
2020 - 2025 Edition


## Outlook in Asia Pacific Ageing Market 2020 – 2025



   - Senior Housing Communities (Independent
Living) – ranked fourth at 11% and

   - Assisted Living Facilities (on demand
assistance) – ranked sixth at 9%.

We noted that overall Senior Residential Housing
with care services remains as the most immediate
ageing market opportunity, with Residential Care
Facilities (24 hours) emerging as the top most
immediate ageing market opportunity.

Based on our research data and the assumption that
5% of the ageing population requires such facilities,
we have noted that in most countries, excluding
Australia, China, Hong Kong SAR and New Zealand,
have a severe shortage of beds for 24 hours
residential care facilities. The interest and demand
towards Independent Living and Assisted Living
options have been increasing in the recent years as


seniors are more aware of these options.

Home care services remains as one of the top most
immediate ageing market opportunity, and this is inline where most seniors prefer to age-in-place, where
possible and the need to move to a nursing home is
their last option for care.

Shortages of manpower within the aged care sector
and capability development has been one of the key
concerns and discussion points to support an ageing
nation. Specific training programmes for nurses and
caregivers for seniors is a gap that remains to be
addressed, and a mindset shift towards aged care
services career amongst job-seekers is required to
address the shortage of manpower in this industry.

The addition of Ageing Technology category has
taken the spot of one of the top five areas with
immediate ageing market opportunities. Technology

innovations and robotics have penetrated the
residential care and day care services in the last few
years, and it has also moved towards consumer
target where tele-health monitoring and wearable
devices have gained some traction too.

With the COVID-19 crisis, tele-consultation has
emerged along with online sessions/ activities to
support the stay-home seniors, and this has led to
overall population including seniors to embrace
technology products and services.

**Which market segment represents the biggest**
**economic opportunity for ageing businesses?**

Compared to the 2015 report, Middle Income
segment still represents the most significant business
economic opportunity for the ageing market. This is
followed by High Net Worth clientele and those of the
lower income. The major distribution remains the


same.

We noted that the Lower Income group has
increased from 2% in the past report to 11% in our
current report. As more governments strategise and
implement initiatives to support the ageing
population, the target is usually focused on the
general population and in some, it is targeted to lower
income who would require such government
assistance.

With governments providing more welfare to the
lower income seniors through the various schemes
and policies, there is an opportunity for public-private
collaboration to tap into the lower-income segment
too. However, the main focus of the private sector
remains on the middle income and the high net worth
group, as seen by the growth in senior living market
in Hong Kong, India, China and Malaysia.

**What types of products and services will address**
**the needs of a more affluent and well-educated**
**baby boomer population?**

Based on the answers that we have received from
our survey respondents, below are key themes that
have appeared most frequently for this question.

Health and aged care services are identified to be the
most attractive sector in addressing the needs of a
more affluent and well-educated baby boomer
population. These include home care services,
wellness and healthcare programmes, products and
services that help to support active ageing and
ageing-in-place.


Wellness, communities, active ageing and lifestyle
activities along with quality services expected, are
the recurring themes where baby boomers is the
generation that had worked hard, saved well,
independent, better educated and well-travelled.They
have higher expectations on how they age and the
services and products that would be available to
support them to age independently and healthily, and
for some, in luxury and comfort.

Technology and tele-healthcare devices have also
been highlighted as an upcoming theme for the
affluent baby boomer population. This is followed
closely by senior housing, where an integrated care
concept is much preferred – recreational facilities,
programmes and 24 hours care services.

**MS JANICE CHIA, Founder & Managing Director, Ageing Asia, Singapore**

“With 1.2 billion people aged over 60 in Asia by 2050, ageing presents a social and
economic growth engine that will change the way we live, work and play. Ageing is not
one homogenous market. Instead it is an eco-system of multi-industry niche business
opportunities that requires research, experimentation, market segmentation and indepth understanding of customer perception of product value. The next lap that will
drive the future of ageing in Asia Pacific is about successfully engaging both
consumers and industry.

**DR THE HONOURABLE LAM CHING-CHOI, SBS, JP, Member of the Executive Council, Hong Kong Special Administrative**
Region, The People’s Republic of China, Chairman, Elderly Commission of Hong Kong SAR and Chief Executive Officer, Haven of
Hope Christian Service, Hong Kong SAR

“It would continue to be an upward ageing trend, but more systematic policies would be
implemented by Asia Pacific governments to tackle root problems. Instead of retirement
plans, more young-old would explore their second career. And there is likely to be a
wave of participation by the private sector conglomerates in silver economy, providing
stimulation to the whole sector of eldercare.”

**MR KAZUMI NISHIKAWA, Director, IT Industry Division, METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry), Japan**

“2025 is just a beginning of a new challenge. The real challenge will be in 2030s when
China, Thailand, Singapore and Korea will be "super-aged societies" by WHO definition.”

**MR TAN KWANG CHEAK, CEO, Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), Singapore**

“The outlook on ageing is an optimistic and positive one. The focus of countries and
societies on their senior population increase, leading to greater scope for innovations,
new models and expanded efforts to cater to the needs and aspirations of these seniors.”

“The courage and dedication and professionalism displayed by aged care staff in our
region in the face of a global pandemic has been extraordinary. Their response has
reinforced the need to invest even more into supporting and developing frontline care
staff. I’m confident that the sector will emerge from the Covid-19 challenge even

**MR PATRICK TSANG, General Manager, Hong Kong Housing Society, Hong Kong SAR**

“Both the public and private sectors will invest more in elderly healthcare and
related businesses.”

**MR KENNETH SHE, CEO, Humansa, Hong Kong SAR**

“The silver economy is a broad ecosystem that would rely on the joint effort of multiple
stakeholders in the society to make it work. This has in fact been taken place in a rapid
manner, and I can see lots of support and input from the commercial world, NGOs as
well as governments to the ageing sector, especially on innovation and technology,
favourable policies and creative business models. I am optimistic to the future of ageing
in 2025.”

**MR PATRICK CHEUNG, Chairman, The Jade Club Ltd, Hong Kong SAR**

“By 2025, baby boomers will reach the age of 80. This cohort will demand service,
which is very different from the earlier generation. They are more educated, well
traveled, and have seen what is possible in other countries. They are also much more
affluent with their housing asset. The key is how to channel this demand to innovative
entrepreneur.”

**PROF HIROYUKI MURATA, Professor, Smart Aging Research Center, Tohoku University, President, Murata Associates, Inc.,**
Japan

“The youngest baby boomers in Japan will over 75 years old in 2025. This means that
pace of health status changes such as dementia and locomotive syndrome will be
accelerated. Although the Government had set a goal to establish local comprehensive
care system s nationwide by 2025, it will not be completed. Because of the budget
overspending by the government due to the COVID-19, the balance sheet of the
government will be ultra-deficit and may lose its financial credibility. Under the social
conditions above, the private sectors including new start-ups may take much initiative
instead of the government to create more innovative solutions towards the challenges
due to the Ultra-super-aged society.”

**DR NG WAI CHONG, Founder and CEO, NWC Longevity Practice, Singapore**

“Aged-care will be even more de-centralized - there will be more online platforms;
more home-based service delivery; closer health and psychosocial integration; small
group co–living rather than big residential facilities. Pandemic preparedness will be
part of the regulations.”

**MDM LOW MUI LANG, Executive Director, The Salvation Army Peacehaven, Singapore**

“The future of ageing is positive as the future elderly will be better prepared to age
gracefully by keeping themselves fit. I foresee more early intervention programmes for
the elderly such as fitness programmes being rolled out in the community. With
increased social networking, there will also be peer pressure amongst the elderly to stay
healthy. Social service agencies will continue to provide services for the elderly and
extend engagement programmes to reach out those living alone.”

**MR NICK ABBEY, Chairman, Associated Retirement Community Operators, The United Kingdom**

“I think that we will have seen increased awareness by all governments of the need to
provide more housing options for older people; more innovation by developers; a
greater use of technology; a linking of solutions for older people's housing or lifestyle
with solutions for climate issues, and more sharing of experiences between countries.”

#### Interviews with top global care sector industry leaders

**MR DANIEL REINGOLD, President & CEO, RiverSpring Health, USA**

“We baby boomers thought we would die without ever getting old. We upended every
other system — suburbia, education, child-rearing, college campuses — but not longterm care. Now the pandemic is forcing us to take care of the design and delivery of
long-term care just as the baby boomers are about to overwhelm the system.”

**MR MIKE BOYER, Chief Operating Officer, International Markets, Home Instead Inc., USA**

“Home care is now recognised worldwide as an essential service – like public utilities,
something that is irreplaceable for communities around the world. Even before the
COVID-19 pandemic, demand for home care was skyrocketing due to a rapidly ageing
population and people’s powerful desire to “age-in-place” in the safety and security of
their own homes. Today, home care plays an even more critical role for seniors, their
families, healthcare systems, and economies. How we take it forward on a global scale
will be a central question of post-COVID-19 era.”

**DR CHRISTINE CLARK, Chief Executive, Kalandra Education Group, New Zealand**

“Silver Tsunami is an apt description, but in the business sense, it is more platinum.
The consumerism is being under looked and the narrow, traditional views as to how to
service the needs and wants of the older person are definitely limiting potential
business. Do people even really ask what they want, and do we listen?”

**MR GEOFF HARRISON, Managing Director, The Scarisbrick International Group, (Australia, Philippines, Malaysia, Switzerland)**

“Ageing in the 2020's will be a major factor in the World's vision as most countries will
have a large percentage of their population retired, not income producing, with
dwindling pension/ superannuation funds( if any) and reliant on ever- decreasing
government services. Those same governments will have a substantial reduction in
available income to allocate to the increased retirement sector due to the lower taxes
collectable from a shrinking income producing population base. So Retirees will have
to rely on self-funding if they want high quality services as government service quality
and quality will decrease. Many Countries will also lack available, properly trained
home care staff within their own population ( e.g. Singapore, Australia, Malaysia,
Thailand, New Zealand etc), and will look to increasing those resources from external
sources to help lower cost care.”

## Ageing Market Business Insights: What is your outlook on the future of ageing in 2025?
#### Interviews with top global care sector industry leaders

**MR TONY BRIDGE, Managing Director, Bridge Advisory Group, Australia**

“Given the COVID-19 scenario, there is likely to be an impact on seniors living options
and business models, with a particular focus on operating models. With underlying
demographic demand continuing to create strong demand for accommodation,
products and services, I believe the outlook remains strong for the sector. With the
development of a COVID-19 vaccine combined with the increasing prevalence of
baby-boomers in the target demographic for seniors accommodation and care. There
is a strong likelihood that the new normal post COVID-19 will include a higher reliance
on technology, and this will play a key role in development of new operational models.
Notwithstanding this, ongoing demand for contemporary, lifestyle focus
accommodation with care options available in an inter-generational setting is likely to
still form a key element in the future outlook for ageing.”

**MS JULIE OCKERBY, CEO & Principal Creative Designer, Meli Studio, Australia**

“With a proactive approach to implementing change to the issues that has been
discussed, I have a very optimist view to the ageing outlook in 2025. But it is time for
less talk, and more real action towards innovation.”

**MR DAVID LANE, Emeritus Chairman, Thomson Adsett, Australia**

“Having spent the past 40 years working actively in this area and speaking widely about
ageing, design and care both domestically and internationally I am particularly focused
on the changing trends of ageing. It is my hope that the Asian sector in particular will
focus its attention on health and wellness within the community first and foremost, and
in respect of the provision of housing options for older people, will focus heavily on
integrating their older populations within residential communities by providing services,
planning and operational incentives to do so.”

**MR ARTHUR KOUMOUKELIS, Partner, Thomson Geer, Australia**

“Continuing and growing sophisticated demand levels are pushing providers to develop
better delivery models - services and accommodation. This is an opportunity for
providers and developers to build the new communities that meet the demand.
Ultimately building a ‘supported living home’.”

**MR TAKESHI HAENO, Associate Director, Monitor Deloitte Strategy, Healthcare Strategy, Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting LLC,**
Japan

“I believe, in the future, we will see the society that aged people can have happier lives
with their independence, dignity, and communities they belong. Workload of caregivers
will also be more optimized so that caregivers can better support aged people
holistically. A variety of innovation, driven by advancement of technologies (e.g.
robotics, AI, XR, IoT), adaption of behavioral science, and further introduction of publicprivate partnership will play an important role to realize the future, and these innovation
will be supported by solid evidence and data. Some care providers will be merged or
have alliance to keep up these innovations. The key question will be how far we can go
by 2025. The answer will differ by countries/regions. While I foresee human will remain
to play a critical role in providing care, we will see some “wow” innovations, which help
aged people and caregivers, widely implemented in coming 5 years.”

**MS PAT SPARROW, CEO, Aged & Community Services Australia (ACSA), Australia**

“The success to date of the Australian aged care sector in responding to the COVID-19
pandemic highlights the resilience and depth of the capability of the industry. As the
industry continues to grow in coming years and decades in line with the ageing
population, there will be more opportunities than ever before to maximise the health and
wellbeing of older Australians through aged and community care services. There will
doubtless be innovation within Australian aged care as providers find new and creative
ways to respond to the needs and preferences of older people – from new models of
accommodation to new modes of service delivery. Government policy will need to adapt
accordingly to ensure the sector is funded and structured in such a way as to allow
creativity and consumer choice to thrive.”

**MR JOHN COLLYNS, Executive Director, Retirement Villages Association, New Zealand**

“The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will have economic, health and security concerns
for many years. While the impact on jobs is going to be an issue for many younger
people, a decline in the return on investments is going to be a real challenge for many
older people. Organisations that managed the health risk effectively and made sure
older people felt (and actually were) secure are going to see the benefits of that.”

**MR VICTOR MILLS, Chief Executive, Singapore International Chamber of Commerce, Singapore**

“While the current pandemic is a tragic and significant reversal, because it impacts
the over 65s more than others, the long term trend of ageing is bright.”

“CX as a driver for sustainable performance improvement - Around the globe, aged
care services face increasing resource constraints alongside increasing consumer
expectations. Providers that excel in this environment, and see sustainable
performance improvement, will be those that define or redesign consumer experience
strategies (CX) around regular stakeholder feedback. The investment of time and
resources to fully understand the needs of consumers, families, and staff will lead to
better wellness, satisfaction, and therefore business outcomes.”

“We are looking at a fairly positive outlook as the general public appears to be more
interested in ageing and what that needs to look like and how it needs to be supported.”

**MS STEPHANIE LAW, Managing Director, Culture Homes & CTL Group, Hong Kong SAR**

“During COVID-19, most households and old aged homes are taking more prudent
infection control measures. The demand for epidemic prevention supplies and antiseptic
disinfectant products spiked, products such as surgical masks and sanitising products at
home has become a repurchasing commodity. More manufacturers and companies
have shifted their strategies to cater the growing consumer needs. We also expect that
the government will continue to demand a higher level of hygiene standards in old aged
homes, resulting in higher demand of anti-microbial products (i.e. toilet fixtures and care
furniture with silver ion technology). These products will also play a major role in future
elderly home projects.”

**MRS MARIA LEE, Executive Director, Roseville Senior Living Management Ltd, Hong Kong SAR**

“The global population is ageing while the workforce is shrinking. An ageing population
poses challenges to the healthcare, social welfare and elderly care services. The demand
for residential homes for the elderly always outweighs the supply. Concept of ageing-inplace as the core, institutional care as back-up had been advocated. With effective health
protection and promotion, many diseases are preventable, and a significant proportion of
disability in older persons is reversible by means of rehabilitation. Thus rapid
development of preventive healthcare and community rehabilitation, together with
gerontechnology would enable elderly to graciously retire in style and happily age in
place.”

“The increasing life expectancy will drive growth as companies will be forced to
develop products, services, and innovations to serve the needs and aspirations of the
ageing population. This will lead to an increased attention by the government to
professionalise the sector and regulate it. With that, we will see an increase in

emerge. We will also see an increased rate of adoption of technology in day to day
life, and more importance of preventive care and wellness, which will lead to a positive
outlook on senior living communities.”

**MR HERMAN KWIK, Founder, RUKUN Senior Living, Indonesia**

“As the demographic figures show, the number of seniors will continue to rise, and in
many countries will represent an increasing percentage of the overall population. So,
the need for senior services and housing solutions will continue to increase.”

**MR GUSTAV STRANDELL,CEO, Maihama Club Nursing Homes, Japan**

“All healthcare services which contributes to independence of elderly will have a strong,
positive growth.”

**MS HISAKO TAKASE, Founder, Mirai Wo Tukuru Kaigo Café, Japan**

“A community-based integrated care system means rebuilding a community of mutual
help within the community. This system, which is entrusted to the local government, is
not limited to the framework of a uniform system of the country, and it also means that
it is possible to create a social security system and town development that take
advantage of the characteristics of the region. I think that it can be considered as a
good opportunity to start a new community business that involves various generations
starting from the region.”

more efficient and high quality service being required.”

**DR JUN SASAKI, Founder & Chairman, Yushoukai Medical Corp., Japan**

“In 2025, the baby boomer generation in Japan will be over 75 years old. From here
on out, the number of elderly people in Japan will stop growing. Meanwhile, the
number of children and the working population will continue to decline, and the elderly
will become even older. But this will not be a weakness for Japan. The elderly
continue to get younger (The physical functioning of the elderly Japanese gets
younger by 5 years every 10 years). And due to the evolution of technology and
changes in social practices, the decline in physical functioning is not a handicap (The
most severely disabled person on a ventilator is now a member of parliament). Older
people are not just weak beings to be cared for. They are being transformed into
workers with individual abilities and consumers with sufficient assets. A new society
based on a 100-year life expectancy is taking shape.”

#### Interviews with top global care sector industry leaders

**DR OW CHEE CHUNG, CEO, Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital, Singapore**

“Today, the COVID-19 situation provides us with a glimpse of how the future of ageing
will be in 2025. We need to change the paradigm from “Hospital to Community” to a
“Community Lead Healthcare system”. This requires all aspect of resources,
infrastructure to shift towards the community. The use of technology and IT to connect
people and services/information. The scarcity of manpower resources to run the
services and the need for the community to come in to support the elderly and
vulnerable. All these are playing out every day in Singapore today; we should not
dismantle all these systems, but rather enhanced them. The only difference in 2025 is
that we hope there is no virus, but a vibrant society where the elderly living in the
community are healthy and engaged.”

**MR NATHANIEL FAROUZ, Chief Executive Officer, ORPEA, China & Singapore**

“Home care and other solutions for ageing-in-place will continue to develop, making
purely residential senior living solutions relatively less attractive. Residential care will
have to keep reinventing itself to become more technical, with an increasing focus on
the most dependent people who can no longer stay at home.”

**MS WINNIE CHAN, Executive Director, SJSM Nursing Home, Singapore**

“The outlook is still good as ageing issues are gaining traction worldwide. If only we
could have a global committee (like climate change) to tackle and share best practices
among government and NGO organisations, to champion more push from the ground.”

**MR JAMES TAN, Chief Executive Officer, TOUCH Community Services**

“The unprecedented Covid-19 global outbreak has upended the lives of vulnerable seniors.
Although the immediate future may look uncertain, we can turn this crisis into an opportunity
for growth and innovation. The future outlook bodes well for Singapore’s eldercare sector as
this can be a time for organisations to rethink, recalibrate and refresh current service
models, and adopt a more sustainable care approach by increasing resources while
reducing care needs. Our community enablement efforts have shown the potential of
harnessing community assets and equipping residents as resources to stay well mentally
and physically to support ageing in community. As we build community resilience and
stronger families, seniors can be empowered to make meaningful contributions to their
communities and lead fulfilling lives. With technology as the key driver of change, we want
to up-skill seniors and help them maximise their digital experience and capabilities to stay
healthy and socially connected.”

**MS HYE JUNE PARK, President, The Aspen Tree, Thailand**

“As the ageing population is expected to increase, some main concerns include,
dependency ratio and how the public health system would care for seniors equitably and
equally. In developing countries, older people who have wealth or family support are likely
to be able to take care of themselves whereas the majority has to struggle with their
restrained finance circumstances. One of the solutions is to raise awareness about health
promotion;, teaching people aged 40+ years old to prepare and care for themselves, not
just in healthcare, but also financial conditions. From my perspective, ageing policy
implemented from government in many countries are practical in short term, and need to
be amended frequently to reach sustainability, due to global impulse or domestic factors
that are changing every year. There is a positive outlook in the next five years if everyone
takes these issues into account.”

**MR CLIFF COOK, Chairman, LifeCare Residences, The United Kingdom and New Zealand**

“Ageing is changing rapidly as health sciences underpin growing longevity. Our
understanding of the impacts of isolation, loneliness, boredom and feelings of despair
growing out of helplessness have driven the emerging new models of care delivered in
small home environments. The institutional model will make way for a more
comprehensive service rich model individualised to the specific social, emotional, health
and wellbeing needs of the client. Care of older people will shift from looking after
people with failing abilities to a care model that is much more wholistic! Further, rapidly
emerging technologies will force change to the way home care services are delivered
and responded to. There will be a much stronger community focus and a growing
presence of virtual care homes and villages. Smart phones and connectivity of “things”
like fall detection or GPS enabled geofencing will greatly influence the care of those with
cognitive or memory impairment. Finally, our societies will forget about “retirement” as
they work longer to remain engaged and active and older people will seek to support
themselves by buying services to be delivered in their own home. Their own home may
well be within suburban communities or retirement villages that are more seamlessly
integrated with surrounding intergenerational communities. Meeting needs associated
with ageing in future will require of us to be agile and flexible in the meeting and delivery
of unique service requirements.”

**PROFESSOR JEAN WOO, Emeritus Professor of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR**

“Good growth as societies will be forced to confront issues that had been ignored with
population ageing, both in prevention and management of functional dependencies.”

**MR WONG KIT LOONG, ex-CEO, Hong Kong Housing Society, Hong Kong SAR**

“The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will have economic, health and security concerns

“In an ageing world, calibrated migration from more youthful countries to countries with
demographic ageing and shortage of labour will occur as some countries are ageing
more slowly than others. The “younger” countries will become labour exporting
countries and the “older" countries will have to become labour importing countries with

“With the prospect of people getting older, topics such as fitness and rehabilitation will
be given high priority in the health sector.”

**MR AARON GOH, Business Development Manager, Active Lifestyle Pte Ltd, Singapore**

“People will still be ageing. The question probably will be how they would be ageing. In
regard to Asia Pacific, this ageing process will be very varied throughout each region
depending on how developed the cities are and what kind of policies each adopt. This is
further defined by the economic stature of each nucleus family. Though I cannot speak
of other nations, being a Singaporean, I can only say that the Singapore government
has taken significant steps to address this by building more infrastructure and policies to
handle the different stratification of social standings.”

programmes will continue to proceed to good success. If not, there will be little change
to what we are experiencing currently.”

“The ageing trend in Asia will boost the growth of the longevity economy, especially the
increase of the young old (aged 60-80) both in terms of their demand for new products
and services, but also in terms of their under-tapped productive potential currently
limited by outdated retirement policies and labor market rigidity.”

“Taiwan just entered an advanced society in March last year. The general public’s
understanding of the elderly population is still generally based on long-term logic to
understand market demand. In fact, it is very biased, narrow and incomplete. The
richness is mainly to promote a sustainable and healthy organic lifestyle. In this way,
the formation of a cohousing and coexisting ecosystem is to improve the compatibility

expectations for how they should retire well in life. Everyone should have access to
tools and facilities to help them live a healthy life; expects to lives longer and participate

## Ageing Asia Future Trends in the Business of Ageing
### Top 10 Asia Pacific Silver Economy Trends: How will baby boomers drive the growth of the silver economy?

_By Janice Chia, Founder & Managing Director, Ageing Asia Pte Ltd, Singapore_


_*Trends are not listed in any particular order_

**Ageing Asia Future Trend #1: The Business of**
**Dementia**
Improving care and enabling daily living for persons
with dementia

Worldwide, 50 million people have dementia, and
there are nearly 10 million new cases every year.
The prevalence of dementia impacting ourselves and
our loved ones may soon be as common as having a
chronic disease. A diagnosis of dementia will mean
awareness of the situation and provide opportunities
for early interventions, and living at home for as long
as possible with the support of additional home care
services as our cognitive and physical conditions
decline.

The Business of Pre Dementia is to encourage the
general healthy ageing population to reduce the
possibilities of dementia through regular physical and
brain exercise activities, better nutrition, healthy
lifestyle and sleeping patterns. Opportunities include:
Senior Health and Wellness Clubs, Health Monitoring
Technologies, Specialist Clinics for Preventive
Healthcare and Chronic Disease Management.


The Business of Mild to Moderate Dementia is to
slowdown the decline of cognitive abilities through
areas mentioned above, and also to create social
interactions and connections to create a support
network akin to a second family. Additional
opportunities include home modifications with
assistive living products, mobility devices, falls and
movement monitoring technologies, medication and
emergency alert systems, smart home intelligence
technologies, home buddy and caregiver services,
dementia day social and care centres, and senior
living communities with care services.

The Business of Severe Dementia is to create a
supportive living environment for people who are no
longer able to live independently at home and require
a secure, safe and supportive living facility that has
24 hours nursing care. One such example, is the
wissner-bosserhoff memoriana room concept for
dementia from Germany that enables clients that
require supported care. Other opportunities include
memory support focused senior living communities
with care services (Dementia Village Communities)
that enable a high staff to client ratio for
companionship, activities and daily living support,
Technologies for communication with families,
movement and health monitoring, brain and exercise
programmes, Personalisation of social activities to
encourage engagement and interactions.

**Ageing Asia Future Trend #2: The Business of**
**Care Technologies**
Acceleration of demand for assistive, operational and
companion robotic technologies

The biggest market for senior care technologies is to
help improve efficiency and productivity for staff, to
enable them to allocate more time towards providing
care and social engagement with seniors, as well as

applying the data relevantly to support care delivery

A key challenge for the sector is to overcome the
misconception that technology will replace human
connections when we care for seniors. Prior to the
pandemic, companies like ASCOM founded in
Switzerland, were already frontrunners in delivering
straight forward and non-obtrusive technology
solutions for seniors.

One of the positive outcomes in the global fight
against the COVID-19 pandemic is the rapid
acceleration of the technology adoption curve for the
aged care sector, and the use to technologies to
enable independence for seniors

The Business of Care Technologies includes five
broad areas:

   - Demand for cloud communication, telehealth,
remote business and remote clinical functions;

   - Demand for assistive technologies to support
care workers with client monitoring for falls
prevention, health monitoring of medical
conditions, robotic aid assistants to perform


repetitive or delivery tasks around the
facilities;

   - Demand for smart home intelligence
technologies that enable seniors to live at
home with independence, including home
appliances, assistive living products, and
health monitoring technologies; and Support
for daily living activities including robotic baths
and smart hoists;

   - Demand for companion robots with artificial
intelligence to help support seniors with
Dementia and social engagement; and

   - Demand for technology innovations such as
virtual reality that help facilitate remote staff
training and training stimulations.

**Ageing Asia Future Trend #3: The Business of**
**Healthy Ageing**
A mindset shift towards self-empowerment of
physical and cognitive health

The desire for independence, dignity in old age and
mobility is driving a mindset shift in baby boomers
towards ageing in good health and extending their
healthy life expectancy. Seniors today are living
longer and living healthier. The business opportunity
emerging is about how we can create products and
services that enable seniors to be in a better state of
health, age stronger and to live longer at home.

The new generation of seniors, the baby boomers
have higher expectations on quality of life and are
better educated. There are more opportunities for
ageing in good health through lifestyle changes, food
intake, wellness and nutrition.

### Top 10 Asia Pacific Silver Economy Trends: How will baby boomers drive the growth of the silver economy?

_By Janice Chia, Founder & Managing Director, Ageing Asia Pte Ltd, Singapore_

While previous generations of ageing seniors would
think a morning walk around the park is sufficient, the
current generation drives new business opportunities
as they pursue strength training and balance for falls
prevention, cognitive health, use of technologies and
even incontinence prevention. They also appreciate
the personalised approach towards planning and
monitoring their health and wellness; including
preventive health management solutions for chronic
diseases, food and nutrition.


People will not age at the same pace, the ageing
population will be further segmented into smaller
niche segmented markets. This will include niche
markets such as older female consumers, seniors
with special dietary needs and personalisation of
services.

The baby boomers are growing older, but they are
also ageing with more disposable income and
willingness to spend on products and services that
will help to improve their health and quality of life. In
recent years, new products targeting this clientele
has gained popularity, such as seniors targeted
furnishing that that is colourful, purposeful and nonageist in design thinking from Moments Furniture in
Belgium.

Health insurance and long term care financing are
changing with the rising healthy ageing population as
they will expect lifetime insurance coverage and
access more chronic disease management and
rehabilitation services.

Wellness services, technologies and health
management services that empower and enable
seniors to stay active, reduce reliance on medication,
improve physical and cognitive health outcomes will
see rising demand.


In Hong Kong SAR, the Humansa brand targets a
niche segment of the “sub-healthy” citizen with
customised rehabilitation and wellness programmes.
With longer healthy life expectancy, seniors are likely
to shorten the end of life period, thus reducing the
need for extended end of life care. Services will
continue to focus on the healthy life years for seniors.

According to the latest healthy life expectancy data
by the World Health Organisation (WHO), Singapore
ranks first at 76.2 years old, Japan at 74.8 years old
and Republic of Korea at 73 years old.

**Ageing Asia Future Trend #4: The Business of**
**Fun Rehabilitation**
Gamification of rehabilitation exercises to increase
participation rate.

We want seniors to exercise more to stay active. The
biggest challenge is to encourage sedentary seniors
to exercise and stay motivated in the long term. In
recent years, the concept of gamification of
rehabilitation exercises by combining medical
concepts, sports and competition elements have

gained traction. We see the emergence of Exergaming being applied for the senior wellness sector,
where conventional amusement arcade machines
being repurposed for the senior activity centres,
transformation of popular sports into senior-friendly
activities and integration of new technologies,
including virtual reality, augmented reality and
artificial intelligence.

The Business of Fun Rehabilitation presents an
opportunity for start-ups and non-ageing sector
manufacturers to consider diversifying into products
that can help serve a rising market demand for
activities that will encourage exercise and motivation
for seniors.

The fun approach to rehabilitation for seniors has
proven successful with early movers like HUR from
Finland that focuses on building lifelong strength
though specialist exercise machines, Namco Bandai
Holdings, the company behind popular arcade
phenomenon in the 1980s turn from mass youth
market to the silver generation market by installing
modified arcade machines at Kaikaya nursing home,
a wholly owned unit by the company in Japan, with


the goal to provide fun exercise entertainment to the
seniors, and Swedish company Bunne Music
introduced a modified musical instruments, e.g.,
Bunne Swing Guitar that enabled a more inclusive
music therapy sessions, where people with dementia
are able play musical instruments easily.

There are five key success factors for products that
enable fun rehabilitation for seniors:

   - Evidence based research on benefits and
improvements

   - Pilot implementations with seniors

   - Scalability

   - User data collection for analysis

   - Ease of use.

Ageing will not be a burden, if we are able to explore
opportunities to reduce and rehabilitate physical
impediments to good health.

**Ageing Asia Future Trend #5: The Business of**
**Rehabilitation Tourism**
Short stay medical travel and rehabilitation holidays

Baby boomers in Asia Pacific are not likely to migrate
permanently out of their countries of origin in search

their needs and retirement expectations will impact
through different sectors of our economy.

The social and economic contributions of seniors
who are living longer means that they are staying
employed longer, increasing consumer spending
years and being informal caregivers. The potential
implications of a 100 year life means that healthy life
years are increasing, and their purchasing patterns
widen beyond healthcare consumption to other
sectors.


in each country for three to six months at a time. This
would boost revenue in tourism and healthcare
services within each country.

The travel, leisure, wellness and healthcare sector
that would like to capture this market should aim to
create product offerings that would suit baby
boomers. For example, retirement resorts with
activities and health rehabilitation packages to suit
baby boomers looking for short stay solutions;
mainstream hotels and resorts partnering with
hospitals to offer short stay wellness and
rehabilitation packages including cancer treatments
and post-surgical recuperation.

**Longevity Economy**
The implications of the 100 year old life in
transforming the way we live, work and play

Increasing lifespans represent new economic
opportunities to drive innovation and prosperity. The
market of products and services to promote to the
ageing population widens the longer they live and


The longevity economy is defined by the American
Association of Retired Persons (AARP) as the
economic contributions of people age 50 and older,
and how they are driving the economic growth
engine, stimulating jobs and creating opportunities for
all.

The demands driven by the business of a longevity
economy points to several factors. Firstly, the
opportunities driven by extending healthy life years to
enable people to stay in employment longer.
Companies need to innovate to look at how to look
after ageing workers by integrating new technologies
to reduce heavy lifting, keeping employees healthy
though wellness programmes, and encouraging work
life balance.

Secondly, baby boomers have higher expectations of
quality of life, they do not see age as a barrier and
they are looking for products that will enable them
with independence.

Thirdly, with extension of healthy life years, baby
boomers will seek travel and lifestyle services that
will provide them with experiences, feel trendy and
participate actively in the global e-commerce
shopping arena as a new generation of tech savvy
consumers.

Fourthly, urban planning and services will be age
inclusive and barrier free by default as the needs of
the ageing population take centre stage to help make
everyday life easier for seniors in our community.

Lastly, in the area of retirement planning and
financing, product innovations including annuities,
private pensions, insurance, and long term care
financing are expected to be in demand to fund the
100 year life.

Traditional notions of life stages where we study,
work and retire will change. The multi stage life will
become the new normal where we experience a mix
of different life experiences in no fix order across
education, employment, paid and unpaid work,
transition from part-time to full-time work, retirement,
entrepreneurship and sabbaticals.

**Ageing Asia Future Trend #7: The Business of**
**Senior Living and Care Communities**
Specialist senior focused developments with social,
health and care services


The ageing demographic brings a huge wave of
change and opportunity for the real estate sector.
The baby boomer population’s demand for a high
quality standard of living will start to drive
development of specialist accommodation options
that suit their lifestyle and care needs.

More importantly, affluent baby boomers have the
wealth and purchasing power to move into such
communities. With changing mindsets of baby
boomers towards ageing away from their children to
maintain their own independence, the opportunities in
Asia Pacific are exponential.

Developers who wish to capitalise on this space must
make an investment in the silver market by
dedicating resources towards both development of
the communities and operations. They must also be
willing to provide the full spectrum of services from
social, health to care to support baby boomer to agein-place, whilst at the same time enabling a long term
sustainable business model.

Currently, a few countries in Asia have senior living
and care communities that can address the needs of
baby boomers. Instead, many of these senior
facilities in the market are focused on clinical nursing,
dementia and palliative care, instead of lifestyle and
active ageing focused where the vision is
independence rather than care.

The market opportunity for the business of senior
living and care communities will be driven by the
following fundamental insights on baby boomer
consumers. Firstly, they desire ageing-in-place. They
are willing to downsize from their landed houses and
large apartments into a senior living community if the
location is close to their current residence due to the
social connections and familiarity of the community.

Secondly, the product needs to be aspirational to
meet the standards of affluent baby boomers.

Thirdly, the current and future provisions for care and
supported living for seniors must be subtle - available
when required, and concealed when not required so
that the environment does not force the physical
decline of ageing upon its occupants.

Fourthly, the services offered must provide choice for
an empowered generation of seniors. The decision
making must remain in the hands of the seniors and
not with the operators of the development.

Lastly and most importantly, the happiness of
residents where the environment provides a second
family community and social support network to
reduce loneliness and encourage social engagement.

A system of measurements, benchmarks, data
analysis and resident feedback must be put in place
to ensure the highest standards of happiness for
residents who living in senior living and care
communities. If real estate developers start from the
end goal, which is to prevent hospitalisations and an


overly clinical approach towards care for seniors, the
answer is simple. The future product must combine
active ageing, lifestyle aspirations and a ready suite
of care services that can be called upon when
required.

**Ageing Asia Future Trend #8: The Business of**
**Loneliness**
Enabling social connections and engagements

In the United States of America (USA), loneliness
costs them almost US$7 billion extra in healthcare
costs each year. Loneliness is not the same as social
isolation. People can be isolated (alone) and yet do
not feel lonely. People can be surrounded by other
people, yet still feel lonely.

The pandemic has amplified the challenges of
loneliness amongst the seniors, yet at the same time,
it has also provided the population at large who has
had to stay home, with an opportunity to experience
the loneliness and social disconnections felt daily by
many seniors.

The far-reaching impact of loneliness drove one
organisation from the USA, Home Instead Senior
Care, to conduct a first-of-its-kind study with 600
seniors to measure mealtime routines, challenges
and preferences of seniors age 75 plus who live by
themselves in their own homes or apartments. The
result of the study revealed that increased
opportunities for seniors to share meals with others
will promote nutritional and emotional well-being.

With falling fertility rates, smaller families and more
single people ageing, today’s baby boomers are
facing a real scenario of ageing alone without their
loved ones around them. Women will outlive men
due to feminisation of ageing, children will live apart

from their parents due to globalisation, and people
will age with lesser siblings or no siblings due to
smaller families and fertility rates.

The seniors are the most vulnerable to the negative
effects of loneliness and this also provides a market
opportunity for the business of loneliness. It will
provide an economic opportunity whilst addressing a
social challenge. In Japan, security company
SECOM, provides a once a week check-in
subscription-based service to check in on seniors
who live alone.

In the United Kingdom, a Minister for Loneliness was
appointed in 2017, signifying the importance of this
issue. There are also more entrepreneurs embarking
on social enterprise solutions to help seniors to
connect and participate in social activities.

In Singapore, ASPIRE55 - Asia’s first virtual
retirement village opened in 2014 to help create
social, health and care communities targeted at
assisting middle income baby boomers to age-inplace and increase like-minded social interactions
amongst members.


In Korea, a social enterprise was established by SK
Telecom to manage a service that uses artificial
intelligence (AI) to monitor lonely seniors. The
monitoring is done via voice-enabled “smart”
speakers that picks up signs of danger, or words that
indicate rising states of loneliness or insecurity. The
result of the trigger words will lead to a
recommendation for a visit by local public health
officials.

Although bordering on challenges of privacy, the
direct result of the pandemic also means that more
seniors will benefit from such a remote care service.
With artificial intelligence and emerging new
technologies, more products and services can help to
add on to human interaction versus replacing it. New
companion robots with more AI functions will help to
address this business opportunity and help to
alleviate loneliness.

**Ageing Asia Future Trend #9: The Business of**
**Virtual Care**
Rising willingness of seniors towards technologies for
healthcare and wellbeing management

Globally, seniors had to stay home during COVID-19
for extended periods due to risks to their immunity
and impact of infection on their pre-existing health
conditions. Although some live with family members,
many also live alone and for the first time, they were
isolated and restricted in their movements and
connections with others. The pandemic accelerated
the use of social networking technologies, but more
importantly, it inadvertently forced seniors to adopt
technologies for their healthcare and health
monitoring needs too.

According to Singapore’s Infocomm Media
Development Authority (IMDA) information

communication usage in households and by
individuals annual survey in 2019, at least 76% of
seniors aged 60 and above used an internet-enabled
feature phone or smartphone that year. In 2013, only
18 per cent of such seniors used these devices.

Although seniors are more digitally savvy today, the
idea of seeing a doctor via a telehealth application,
attending a tele-rehabilitation session and accessing
virtual exercise classes would not have been adopted
as quickly if not for the necessity driven by the
pandemic.

A positive outcome of COVID-19 is that the more
seniors use technologies for virtual care, the more
comfortable they will get with accessing healthcare
professionals remotely. This presents a positive
outlook for telemedicine, wellness and healthcare
management innovators to tap on the potential of the
silver economy.

As new virtual care technologies enter the market,
seniors will benefit from the advantages of accessing
healthcare and recovering from the comfort of their
own homes, with even better user experiences in
future. Potentially, seniors will also be able to benefit
from the clinical expertise of a team of doctors
assisting them remotely, addressing various
conditions, without having to travel and or to wait at
clinics for appointments.

A new generation of doctors, nurses, and allied
health professionals will emerge that are digitally
savvy, assisted by a wealth of research that can be
generated from intelligence, wearable motion
sensors attached to their client, and the rising use of
smart home technologies that help to monitor their
health statistics. An example of enabling seniors to
be more independent is BUDDY (A Personal Health
Assistant) by Livefreely that uses predictive artificial


intelligence and remote monitoring from San Jose,
United States of America.

In addition, remote healthcare management also
offers opportunities for family members and
caregivers to be part of this experience. The use of
virtual care technologies may help to lower costs of
accessing healthcare and allied health professionals,
enable more frequent check-in’s with doctors and
therapists. This results in better long term health and
wellness management for seniors.

**Ageing Asia Future Trend #10: The Business of**
**Local Economy**
The 1KM ageing-in-place radius where we live, work
and play

The ageing-in-place vision for seniors gives rise to
big opportunities for businesses looking to access the
silver market. With over 600 million seniors aged
over 60 years in Asia Pacific by 2025, up to 90% will
age in their own homes, without moving into
residential aged care or senior living facilities.

accommodation (often referred to as nursing homes).

The Australian aged care sector – once a small,
cottage industry attached to a much bigger acute and
primary health system – is evolving into a significant
stand-alone sector employing millions of people in a
variety of settings and services.

This evolution and growth has led to several new
entrants coming into the sector, as well as
consolidation as existing and new organisations join
forces to tackle some of the biggest challenges of
providing care to a growing ageing population. The
sector has a healthy mix of mission-based, not-forprofit providers alongside for-profit companies, with a
small number of government-run services still
existing, particularly to provide care to special needs
cohorts and in remote areas of Australia.

Australia’s aged care industry is also responding to
cultural shifts in attitudes toward the concept of
ageing. As the baby boomers start to become
consumers of aged care, their priorities and
preferences to remain active and independent will
shape the industry.

Current trends toward in-home care and support
services aimed at maximising independence, and
away from traditional nursing home accommodation,
will accelerate. Baby boomers will also have greater
capacity to pay for aged care services than previous
generations – and in combination with government
measures to boost consumer contributions for aged
care – will likely lead to greater availability of funding
sources for aged care providers to respond to and
meet the needs of Australia’s ageing population into
the future.


The central plank of the reform package was to
increase the contributions that older people make to
the cost of their care, shifting the aged care system
toward a more ‘consumer-pays’ approach and away
from a mostly government-funded model, as well as
to boost price signals in the industry. This included
the introduction of means-tested care fees for inhome care and nursing homes, as well as

15

accommodation deposits for nursing homes.

The reforms were in recognition of Australia’s
changing demographics that meant the current aged
care funding framework has to be adapted for the
new wave of baby boomers.

**GOVERNMENT POLICIES & INITIATIVES**

In 2017-2018, the Australian Government subsidised
aged care services covered up to around 1.3 million
people. Government expenditure was around
US$13.3 billion (AU$18.1 billion), while consumer
contributions were around US$3.6 billion (AU$4.9

14

billion). These figures are projected to increase

over coming decades in line with Australia’s ageing
population, in turn requiring substantial investment /
contribution by the government, industry and
consumers. Public policy changes in the near future
will likely review the possibility of a higher consumer
contribution to aged care for those with greater
capacity to pay.

**‘Living Longer, Living Better’ Aged Care Reform**
**Package**
A key reform to the aged care sector was announced
in 2012 and legislated in 2014. Known as the ‘Living
Longer, Living Better’ aged care reform package, the
reforms had their origins in the recommendations of a
report produced by the Productivity Commission, a
government research think-tank.

**In-Home Care Packages**
In 2017, further reform was made to deregulate the
in-home care market and introduce elements of
‘consumer-directed care’. Previously, in-home care
packages were allocated through a central planning
mechanism called the Aged Care Approval Round
directly to care providers, with consumers then left to
find a provider with a suitable package.

The 2017 reforms switched this up, granting
consumers the funding and allowing them to take
their package to the provider of their choice. While
this was an important step forward in empowering
consumers and opening up the in-home care market
to competitive forces, inadequate funding for the
programme has led to a rationing of packages, with
many people missing out on the essential care they
are eligible for.

**Aged Care Funding**
Looking ahead, the Government has flagged a
shake-up to the way residential aged care (nursing
homes) is funded in Australia, indicating it will look to
replace the Aged Care Funding Instrument with a
new funding mechanism in the next few years.

The Commonwealth Department of Health has
commissioned the University of Wollongong to
develop an alternative funding tool to reduce the
administrative burden on aged care providers and
ensure funding for aged care residents is adequately

16

assessed and recompensed.


enquiry into the state of the aged care sector after
some disturbing instances of abuse came to light at a
government-run aged care home in South Australia.

The Commission has a broad remit to examine the
industry in-depth and make recommendations to
government on how to reform the sector to ensure it
will provide safe and quality care for older

18

Australians.


The Commission is currently considering radical
reform to the sector that would refocus aged care
onto the human rights of seniors, restructure the
composition of the industry and trigger a
considerable boost to government funding for the

19

industry as a result. The Commission is due to

make its final recommendations to Government by
the end of 2020, with any reform likely to be
legislated and implemented in 2021-2022.

**DEVELOPMENT OF ELDERCARE SERVICES &**
**SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES**


As the industry providers welcome a new funding
tool, a larger funding envelope from the government
would be critical in ensuring funding sustainability for

17

the sector, now and in the future.

**Aged Care Royal Commission**
Australia is also conducting a Royal Commission


The demand for aged care services and
accommodation options for seniors is forecasted to
increase along with the ageing population growth
rate, and the spending capacity of baby boomers.
This will include the demand for traditional aged care
choices such as residential aged care (nursing
homes), with some 76,000 new aged care beds

20

needed by 2024, in addition to the demand for

independent living options.

Older Australians want to remain in their own homes
for as long as possible. This means that demand is
also set to increase for in-home care services and
supports to help older Australians maximise their
independence.

## 6.Country Overview: AustraliaCountry Overview: Australia

Traditional aged care services such as nursing,
personal attendant care and home maintenance will
grow alongside other innovative developments that
can help seniors live well in their own home.

Assistive technology will likely play a major role in
helping providers to cater to the needs of and
preferences of older Australians as they age in place.

Despite promising innovations in technology to
enable care delivery to be more efficient, both in a
nursing home and in a person’s existing home,
demand for aged care workers, nurses, allied health
and other health professionals will boom as
Australia’s population ages. This creates enormous
opportunities for younger people to find productive
and meaningful work within this space, as the
demographic landscape shifts.

Flexible accommodation options, somewhere
between a traditional nursing home and a person’s
family home, are also likely to develop, with some
promising new models of assisted living starting to
become available for older Australians. These
options will help seniors to retain the
independence and home-like setting which they
prefer, while also accessing cost-effective personal
care and nursing services when they need it.

**OVERVIEW OF FACILITIES IN AUSTRALIA**

The mix of organisations delivering care may change
over the coming years. The last five to ten years has
seen increasing number of new for-profit entrants
coming into Australia’s aged care market, which had
previously been mostly comprised of charitablebased not-for-profits and government-operated
providers.


Looking forward, the composition of the market may
change again, as many not-for-profits seek to grow
their footprint and scale their services. The concept
of a ‘for-purpose’ organisation is also growing in
popularity within many Australian industries. These
shifts will likely alter the composition and dynamic of
the Australian aged care sector over coming
decades.

In 2018, there are more than 200,000 Australians
living in aged care facilities across the country. There
is approximately 2,672 facilities housing 200,400

21

beds.

Ryman village, their DMF will be no more than 20
percent overall – one of the lowest in the retirement
sector.


**KEY CHALLENGES IN THE AUSTRALIAN AGED**
**CARE SECTOR**

Funding sustainability is the key challenge faced by
aged care providers in Australia. The financial
performance of care providers in the last few years
has declined as government funding has failed to
keep pace with the continued growth in operational
costs, particularly labour costs. As a result, many
aged care providers are finding it increasingly difficult
to meet consumer expectations about quality care
services and achieve strong financial results in the
current funding constrained environment.

These challenges will largely be ameliorated by new
funding amounts and mechanisms that will likely
result from the recommendations of the Aged Care
Royal Commission. The Government has indicated a
willingness to listen to the sector about these
challenges and is cognisant of the difficulties faced in
the industry currently.

The new aged care funding tool currently being
developed by the Commonwealth Department of
Health is also grounds for optimism that more
appropriate funding amounts will flow to care
providers delivering subsidised services to older
Australians.[22]

Another challenge for the industry will be adapting to
new expectations from older Australians and
governments about transparency, accountability and
person-centred or relationship-focussed care. These
new expectations are already being felt by the sector
thanks to an increasing proportion of consumer
contributions as opposed to government funding
within the industry, as well as the increased
emphasis on consumer preferences and
expectations that the baby boomers bring with them
as they begin to become users of aged care services.

Delivering transparency, accountability and quality
care and services that exceed customer expectations
will require a new focus on customer satisfaction,
openness to feedback and a commitment to continual
improvement on behalf of aged care providers.
Shifting to this new mindset and away from the
regulatory compliance approach that the sector has
traditionally adopted will take agility, innovation and a
willingness to embrace new approaches to aged
care.

These challenges, while significant, are not
insurmountable, and Australia’s demographic
imperatives mean the current situation will not persist
for much longer. There is much reason to be
optimistic about the future of the country’s aged care
sector and its capacity to meet the needs and
preferences of Australia’s ageing population now and
into the future.

**OPPORTUNITIES IN AGEING**

Projected to become a super-aged nation by 2040,
Australia’s ageing population market boom is
expected to happen. The significant increase in
demand of this growing consumer group is evolving
the silver economy into a significant stand-alone
sector that employs a wide range of products,
services and care arrangements.

The demand of aged care services and
accommodation options is expected to increase with
the ageing population growth rate and the spending
power of this group. It is forecasted that 76,000 new
aged care beds would be needed by 2024, in addition

23

to the demand for independent living options.

The increasing number of people with dementia,
forecasted to reach 590,000 persons by 2028, would
lead to higher demand for innovative products and


services to support these group, and assist them to
age better in-place or within the residential care
facilities.

**OVERVIEW**

The International Monetary Fund latest economic
update in June 2020 forecasted that China will
experience a reduced growth in GDP to 1% at
US$14.6 trillion in 2020 and is expected to recover

1

and increase to 8.2% in 2021 to US$15.8 trillion.

China’s GDP Per Capita is projected to increase to
US$14,176 in 2025 from US$9,771 in 2018.

China has a population of about 1.4 billion, with more
than 243 million citizens aged 60 and above as of


year 2020. It is forecasted that by 2050, the number
of seniors in China aged 60 and above will almost

2

double to 464.3 million.

Based on data from the Silver Economic Index, life

3

mortality at birth is currently 76.96 years and healthy

4

life expectancy 68.67 years. With a difference of

nine years, some form of assistance would be
needed, ranging from chronic disease management,
health management programme, assisted living
services to nursing care.

## 6.Country Overview: ChinaCountry Overview: Australia

**INDUSTRY OUTLOOK**

China’s population is predicated to peak in 2029 to
1.4 billion, and the world’s most populous country

5

may face a precipitous decline in 2030. 17.8% of

China's population will be aged 65 and above by
2030, an increase from 12.1% in 2018. The old-age

6

dependency ratio is likely to increase to about 30%,


which is about one senior in every four Chinese
people. This dramatically imbalanced ratio would
have an impact on the social and economic

7

development in China, and will put great pressure on

China’s pension system. According to Beijing’s
National Academy of Economic Strategy, China’s

8

pension shortfall could hit $130 billion by 2020.

With the number of seniors rapidly growing and the
population average age is rising as well, this brings to
China a new set of challenges. According to the
“Green Book of Population and Labour” published by
the China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) in
January 2019, China must now establish policies in
an attempt to cope with a declining labour market and

9

a rapidly ageing population.


11

seniors to live with their children in bigger cities.

Many may choose institutional care when their health
starts to deteriorate. In a study by Qian Y, Qin W,
Zhou C, et al., empty nesters would be more
receptive towards institutional care compared to their

12

peers. By the end of 2020, it is estimated that the

Chinese empty nesters will reach 118 million, which
accounts for about 50% of the total ageing

13

population.


Seniors are more likely to suffer from chronic noncommunicable diseases such as cancer and
cardiovascular diseases. According to the National
Bureau of Statistics, as at 2017, seniors with chronic
diseases accounted for 65% of the total ageing

14

population in China. This has placed a great stress

on China’s healthcare system as a whole and the
need for nursing care has increased significantly.

In recent years, the Chinese government has
implemented a number of policies to encourage
medical services to be established in senior care
institutions to release the pressure of the central
health care system.


The one-child policy implemented in 1978 has
changed the traditional family structure and
intergenerational relationship in China. Most families
will, if not has already, face the reality that each adult
needs to care for four to six seniors and the number

10

of children they have.

The first generation from the one child policy has
been experiencing the pressure where it is
challenging to take care of their parents both
financially and practically. Many seniors have also
become empty nesters because their children have
migrated to bigger cities for work or to start a family.
China's household registration system (hukou) and
high housing costs have also made it difficult for


According to the Director of the Science and
Technology Center of the National Working
Commission on Aging, the Chinese government is
encouraging development in the following areas:
senior health management services, geriatric health
care and rehabilitation services, domestic senior care
services, senior culture education, nursing homes,

15

and financial management. In addition, the

Government has been encouraging foreign investors
and domestic enterprises to develop the senior living
and care market. For example, local non-profit senior
care institutions may benefit from the land and tax
policies; and foreign institutions in this sector will be
receiving an equal treatment too.

China has also been introducing pilot projects to
improve their public senior care institutions, scale up
the home and community-based aged care systems,
and integrate medical and nursing services for the

16

seniors.

The State Council requires an expansion of senior
care capacity to reach 35-40 beds per thousand
seniors by the end of 2020. With the assumption that
the capacity remains unchanged at the level of 35-40
beds per thousand seniors, and with a 200 million
increase in the senior population from 2020 to 2050,
this represents a potential demand of 7 million to 8
million new beds for senior care in China.


With the Chinese authorities’ implementation of
measures to accelerate the development of the
senior care service industry, including easing of
regulations and opening up fully the Chinese senior
care market by 2020, investors and players from a
wide range of industries have entered China’s senior
care market in recent years. One Australian property
developer plans to build $2 billion or more worth of
new retirement communities in China by 2025. The
developer is the first foreign organisation to enter
China without a local partner; this pilot programme to
tap into China’s booming senior living market took off

17

in 2019.

In addition to senior living developers, insurance
companies and other business entities have made
plans in China’s senior care market. In terms of
product structure, a variety of care facilities and
services ought to be designed to meet the different
needs of the seniors at different ages. The Chinese
authorities highlighted in a State Council Executive
meeting in August 2019 that the country will further
support the ‘”development of commercial endowment
insurance and establish a long-term care system
linking insurance, welfare and aid, and increase long

term care subsidies for disabled senior citizens living

18

in poverty”.

The current senior care market in China is made up
of providers of various ownership types and
structures. It is also a testing ground for a range of
operational models for service development and
delivery; from state-built and operated, state-built and
privately run, privately operated with government
support to privately run. However, it is still in the
infancy stages to determine which models deliver the
optimal results in China.

**GOVERNMENT POLICIES & INITIATIVES**

Starting from the 2000s, the Chinese government has
increased their attention on the issues relating to a
rapidly ageing Chinese population, and formulated
the concept of the senior care system.


In the last decade, the authorities made significant
strides in revising and formulating policies, starting
with the 12th Five-Year Plan period (2011–2015),
which was a golden age of design, pilot programmes,
and implementation for the policies relating to senior

19

care and services. The three key policies during this

period outlined the vision and framed China’s senior
care system:

**12th Five-Year Plan of Undertakings on Aging – A**
blueprint that established China’s social security
system and the senior care system. This
comprehensive plan covers all areas related to
China’s seniors.

Objectives include:

   - Improve the pension system with the aim to
cover both urban and rural residents and
ensure each senior could receive a basic old

age support.

   - Improve the basic health and medical system,
with provision of health management services,
and to establish health profiles for those over
65 years old.

   - Establish a three-tiered aged care system;
improve the home-based and communitybased care network; achieve 30 beds per
1,000 seniors.

   - Develop technical standards for aged care
facility development in both urban and rural,
upgrade current facilities, and establish
standards for development of new care
facilities.

   - Increase facilities for seniors to enjoy culture,
education, sports, and fitness; increase the
number of universities for seniors.

   - Strengthen management of social work and
set up committees on ageing at different levels

**Development Plan of the Elderly Service System -**
Set the objectives and tasks for establishing China’s
senior service system by 2015. It covers the objective
and structure of the three-tiered aged care system
integral to the needs of China’s seniors – homebased care, community-based care, institutionalbased care.

Objectives include:

   - Raise the number of beds for daily care and
institutional care by about 3.4 million, and
upgrade 30% of the current beds.

   - Improve homes with barrier-free structures for
needy seniors’ families and develop social


service institutions to increase the types of
home care services.

   - Build senior day care centres, nursing homes,
seniors clubs and other community facilities to
strengthen community service and deliver day
care services to all the communities in urban
areas and more than half of the rural areas.

   - Establish rehabilitation and medical facilities
for the institutions. At least one facility in each
county is to provide care services for seniors
who are partially and fully disabled; training
facilities for senior care services to be
constructed at provincial and national levels.

   
   - Encourage development of professional
nursing care and auxiliary equipment; actively
promote special vehicles for senior care.

   - Develop information system and adopt
technology to provide services that are
efficient and easily accessible; regulate the
development of the senior services industry.

**Some Opinions on Accelerating the Elderly**
**Service Industry - This directive from the State**
Council in 2013 established the longer-term targets
for the development of the aged care system by
2020, and provides policy direction. With the view
that by 2020, China would have established the
three-tiered aged care system, the product offering
for seniors would be richer, the market mechanisms
would have improved continuously, and the senior
care system would grow to be a healthy and
sustainable manner.

Objectives include:

   - Improve the service system - The services of
daily living care, medical care, mental care

and emergency support will cover all the
seniors ageing at home. Day care centres and
senior clubs will cover all urban areas; 90% of
townships/ towns and 60% of rural areas will
establish comprehensive community facilities
and stations. The number of beds will
increase to 35–40 beds per 1,000 seniors.

   - Expand scale of the industry - The aged care
service industry in the areas of daily living
care, products, health services, sports and
fitness, culture and entertainment, financial
services, and tourism, will achieve support
and development; leading enterprises and
small and medium-sized enterprises will
create over ten million jobs.

   - Create a favourable institutional environment Policies and laws for aged care services will
be enhanced, and sectoral standards will be
introduced with regulation mechanisms and
service quality to be improved. Social
awareness on the ageing population will be
significantly enhanced, and volunteer services
for seniors will be provided extensively.


Other significant policies include the Guidance on
Combining Medical Services with Elderly Care
Services, issued by the State Council in 2015 that
further promotes the coordination and integration of
medical services and senior care services.

In 2016, the 13th Five-Year Development Plan for
China’s Civil Affairs Sector emphasises on the
development of home based and community-based
care services, and encourages the development of
innovative aged care investment and financing
mechanisms. The plan also explores areas to
establish a long-term care system, and to pilot the
long-term care insurance scheme.

In April 2020, the Chinese central authorities
released the Medium and Long-Term National Plan
for Ageing, a guideline that details “how the
government plans to cope with mounting
demographic stress in the coming decades”. The
policy presents an overall vision that by 2050, China
will be able to support the seniors with “sufficient
income, human capital, innovative technologies,

20

healthcare, and other services”.

**DEVELOPMENT OF ELDERCARE SERVICES &**
**SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES**

The Chinese government previously limited the entry
of foreign investment into the market, but is now
assuming a more open outlook, and provides
stewardship. According to Hao Fuqing, the Deputy
Director of the Department of Social Care of the
National Development and Reform Commission,
China will further eliminate market obstacles to allow
both for-profit and non-profit companies, domestic
and foreign capital to enter and develop the senior

21

care industry.

With the next five to ten years where China
progressively looks to encourage the development of
the aged care industry, state-owned enterprises will
look to invest more, including insurance companies
and developers.


China is seeing more retirement communities with
integrated care services akin to a Continuing Care
Retirement Community (CCRC) that offers services
tailored to needs of the seniors, from independent

22

living, assisted living to skilled nursing care. The

market will see more senior living communities of
various forms - independent living, assisted living,
memory care and skilled nursing with rehabilitation,
being developed and operated nationwide.

Chinese people have traditionally relied on their
children to help them in old age, and it is only in
recent years that institutions for the seniors have

23

gained widespread acceptance. According to a

study done in 2016 on the Chinese high net worth
individuals; 28% of them indicated preference for
medium to high-end senior care homes as their
retirement plan. This marks a jump of 87% compared
to 2015.


In the development of retirement communities, there
are generally two main business models, which is the
“develop and sell” model and “develop and operate”
model. The former model is the traditional property
development, which is preferred by the developers,
but may not be the option preferred by the seniors as
often times, the facility services provided may not be
up to the standard or as promised during the sale.
The “develop and operate” model is preferred by the
seniors as it would come with the provision of
comprehensive aged care services and operated by
the developer or an appointed operator to deliver the
services.

The demand for retirement communities will continue
to increase with the rapidly ageing population. This
demand will attract interest from developers, and in
recent years, insurance companies are becoming
major players in the retirement community sector.
Insurers have the incentives to invest as the
integration with retirement community will enable the
insurers to diversify their business lines with valueadded healthcare and aged care services.

Insurers tend to opt for one of these three models for
senior housing investment:

   - Using own fund to build the retirement
facilities and act as the investor, developer
and the operator

   - Collaboration with third parties with pre-built
retirement facilities

   - A mixture of using own fund to build part of the
facility and collaboration with third parties.

The following insurance companies in China are
frontrunners in senior housing projects - China Life,
China Pacific Insurance Company, Ping An Group,
Taikang Life, Taiping Life and Union Life.

The operational aspects and achieving healthy
occupancy rates may pose as a concern. According
to a census conducted in 2017 by the Peking
University of the 460 nursing homes in China’s
capital, Beijing, two-thirds of privately managed

24

institutions only achieved about 50% occupancy.

There is likely to be a boom of IPOs in senior living in
China in the next five to ten years, and China REITs
are likely to be launched to support healthcare real
estate owners to exit. To address this problem, China
has raised subsidies for private nursing homes in
recent years.


Home-based care service is another area that will be
developed further with the expansion of government
led long-term care insurance pilot programmes.
According to Premier Li Keqiang, “most senior
citizens are enjoying home-based aged care services
supported by communities, which should be further
expanded and diversified”. The Chinese authorities
will be making efforts to develop a variety of homebased senior care services that are supported by the
communities. This include aid in terms of dining,
healthcare, travel and cleaning. New communities
and existing renovated communities are required to

25

include senior care in their support services.

Dedicated dementia care services will be widely
adopted in China. An analysis of 96 observational
studies, published in 2018, reported that the overall
prevalence of dementia in Chinese people aged 60
years and older was 5.30% (4.30% for urban and

26

6.30% for rural). It is estimated that there are about

10-11 million seniors with dementia over 60 years
old, and 60% of them have Alzheimer’s.

Most dementia patients stayed at home and cared for
by their families. The community has begun to realise
that it is not safe to leave seniors with dementia alone


at home, and it is not easy to care for seniors with
dementia at home by themselves. “It seems possible
that China’s one-child policy, which was implemented
in the late 1970s and only phased out from 2015, will
leave too few adults in the 2030s to give sustainable
informal care to all of the dementia cases”, shared

27

authors of a 2016 report published by WHO.

In Shanghai, for example, there are only over 40
government-subsidised, community embedded care
centres to accommodate persons with dementia.
Shanghai was considered a vanguard in coping with
senior care problems; many other China cities failed
to realise the importance to these problems. Though
there are pilot projects in the market, there is a still a
big gap between China and more mature markets.

**OVERVIEW OF FACILITIES IN CHINA**


As of July 2020, China has an estimated 42,300
senior care facilities, with a capacity of over 4.29
million beds, according to statistics released by the

29

Ministry of Civil Affairs.

i i


As of the end of 2018, 48% of the China’s aged care
institutions were privately-run, and community-based
senior care institutions were made available in all
urban areas and available in over 50% of rural

28

communities.

In order to cater to the growing consumer demand,
residential aged care facilities in China have
expanded significantly in both the public and private
sectors. In urban areas, the private sector has
dominated the recent growth. China has three main
types of institutional care facilities that are
differentiated by target clientele, source of revenues,
and levels of care provided, i.e. public social welfare
facilities, nursing homes, and retirement/ community
homes.

**KEY CHALLENGES IN CHINA AGED CARE**
**SECTOR**

Despite a promising future on the demand side,
difficulties in managing and operating senior care and
medical institutions have put various market
players off the market, especially of private capitals,
to invest much time and capital. The business model


China's medical insurance fund expenditure is
increasing at a higher speed than the revenue
growth. When combined with a decreasing workforce
market, the stress on China’s medical insurance fund
will undeniably increase. Therefore, an integrated
medical and senior care services may not benefit all
the seniors through the full coverage of medical

32

insurance alone. This needs to be financial

sustainable for the medical insurance industry to
continue in supporting the escalating healthcare cost
for the seniors.

In the areas of home-based senior care services,
despite presenting a huge market potential, such
services are facing the issue of being excessively
"homemaking based". At present, home and
community based senior care services in China are
not seen to be much different from homemaking
services that can be provided by a homemaking
helper. As a result, home based care service
providers tend to be less recognised by individual
payers.

China’s aged care service industry is highly policy
driven. The development, implementation and benefit
of many projects, institutions, home and communitybased care for the seniors, are still heavily dependent
on the government’s endorsement and procurement

84

i i


of integrated medical and senior care services also
needs to be explored further to minimise poor

30

profitability margins.

Many seniors in China will reach retirement age
without having the required savings to fund their
pensions, health care and lifestyle. According to a
study by the Peking University done in 2013, only 3%
of respondents have commercial pension and 0.2%
have private occupational pension issued by a private

31

employer.

needs.

Success in the Chinese market is attainable, but it
may require a thorough due diligence prior to the
market entry, resources and a steadfast commitment
to remain in the industry despite growing pains that
comes with the early years of operation in China’s

33

senior care services market.

**OPPORTUNITIES IN AGEING**


government has paid more attention to the
development of a smart senior care industry.

The smart aged care industry has attracted
numerous investors’ attention, but it is still at the
infancy stage. In 2017, the authorities announced two
demonstrations of smart health aged care application
pilots. Currently, there are 79 smart health senior
care demonstration enterprises, 130 smart health
senior care demonstration streets (townships), and
29 smart health senior care demonstration bases.


The Chinese government will continue to specify
policies regarding integrated medical and senior
care, which is an integral part of the outline
of China’s grand Healthy China 2030 Plan. The
cooperation between senior care institutions and
institutions providing medical, rehabilitation and
nursing services will be encouraged. Home-visit
medical services will be supported, and training
professionals in related fields, nursing care in

34

particular, will be intensified.

By 2022 China is projected to enable all communities
to be equipped with aged-care facilities, train two
million nursing workers for the seniors, and to launch

35

a variety of senior care insurance products.


The country will further support the development of
commercial endowment insurance and establish a
long-term care system linking insurance, welfare and
aid, and increase the long-term care subsidies for
disabled senior citizens living in poverty, according to
a State Council executive meeting on 21 of August

36

2019.

China’s smart aged care industry has been growing
rapidly since the State Council published a guideline
to promote the development of “Internet+” in July
2015. With an ageing population, the Chinese


Though there are ample opportunities in the smart
senior care industry, many challenges and limitations

37

still need to be resolved. Another area of

opportunities is the market of therapy and
rehabilitation equipment as senior care institutions
are setting up hospitals and rehabilitation centres to
extend their services.

As the role of the private sector is still taking shape,
the Chinese government needs to structure industry
regulations and continue to provide stewardship to
the industry while encouraging greater participation
of the private sector.

## Country Overview: Hong Kong S.A.R

**OVERVIEW**

Hong Kong has a population of over 7 million, with
around 1.8 million or 24.3% of the population aged

1

over 60 as of 2018 ; while the working age population

(those aged 15 to 64) is around 5.32 million or 71%

2

of the whole population .


In other words, this would mean that 1 in 3 person
would be a senior. Meanwhile, the number of people
aged 15 to 64 will shrink to 4.48 million, leading to a
decline in labour force participation rate.

As such, seniors will be expected to rejoin or
continue working in the declining workforce to meet
the manpower demand required. This would imply
that seniors would remain far more relevant in
production and consumption for a significantly longer
period.


According to “Hong Kong Population Projections
2017-2066”, the ageing population is expected to
increase. The number of people aged 65 or above
will reach 2.62 million by 2064, which is 34% of the
population.

The Hospital Authority had estimated the prevalence
rates of dementia is between 5%-8% for seniors
aged 65 and above, and at 20% - 30% among those

institutional care may be higher, estimated to be
30.7% in 2008, as mentioned in a study published in
International Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease 2012.
In the same study, Yu (2012) estimated 333,000
seniors aged 60 and above or 11% of the ageing
population would be suffering from dementia in

is projected that GDP is US$384 billion and GDP Per
Capita is US$49,045 in 2025.

The number of baby boomers born in Hong Kong,
between 1946 and 1965 constitutes almost 30.4% of
Hong Kong’s total population, an immense group with
huge spending power. In the coming years, the
changing age structure of this group will drive the

homes even when they turn frail.

With an ageing population, it is inevitable that
seniors’ employment will start to play a major part in
the economic sector. In 2006, the number of seniors
working is 59,256 and the number increased one-fold

3

to 125,177 in 2016. Additionally, the Hong Kong

SAR Government targets to increase seniors labour
participation through a series of employability
enhancement projects. Therefore, with a higher and
prolonged labour force participation rate, the
consumption of the seniors is projected to increase
steadily.

**GOVERNMENT POLICIES & INITIATIVES**

The Hong Kong SAR Government has always
focused on senior services, and the budget recurrent
expenditure allocated to this area had increased from
approximately US$0.6 billion (HK$5 billion) in 20122013, to approximately US$1.3 billion (HK$10.5
billion) in the Fiscal Year 2019-2020.

**Different Pilot Schemes**
The Government had tried to increase the number of
senior service facilities through a multi-pronged
approach, while also providing additional options for
the seniors through different pilot schemes:

   - The first phase of the Pilot Scheme on
Community Care Service Voucher (CCSV) for
the Elderly[12] was launched in 2013, followed
by a more flexible second phase in October
2016. The Government will launch the third
phase in 2020/21 by increasing the issuance
of vouchers to 8,000, in order to expand the
coverage of ageing population under this
scheme. This is based on the assumption that
the effectiveness review of the second phase

The Consumer Council conducted a report on Hong
Kong residents aged 55 to 79 to study the city’s
ageing consumers’ consumption patterns. The study
found that the commonly consumed non-recurrent
items in “soon-to-be-old" group (aged 55 to 64) were
entertainment/ hobbies/ leisure/ refresher courses
(47.8%), festive/ birthday expenses (45.5%) and
other gifts (41.9%) while travel constituted the largest
share (20.7%) of the ageing consumers’ aggregate
expenditure on the non-recurrent consumption

11

items. This reflected the consumption power of the

“young old” group, highlighting strong buyer purchase
behavior and the opportunities across a range of
sectors.

Additionally, household consumption and living
arrangements can affect seniors’ consumption
pattern. In the report, it was noted that 29.9% of
those aged over 80 were living with their children due
to needs for personal care, whereas 15.2% of those
aged 65 – 79 and 10.4% of those aged 60 – 64 are
more likely to live with their spouses only. In
subsequent years, the increase in seniors
households may imply a higher demand for long-term
care services, especially in the area of home care, as
most of the seniors would prefer to live in their own

2020.

   - The Social Welfare Department (SWD) also
launched a Pilot Scheme on Residential Care
Service Voucher (RCSV)[13] for the Elderly in
March 2017 with a total of 3,000 vouchers
(with value of US$2,018 / HK$15,641, with
effect from 1 April 2020 per month) to be
issued within a period of three years by
batches. The pilot scheme adopting the
“money-following-the-user” principle, provides
greater flexibility and choice for eligible
seniors in need of residential care services
and are wait-listing for care and attention
places on the Central Waiting List. These
eligible seniors can freely choose and switch
Residential Care Homes for the Elderly
(RCHEs) under the Pilot Scheme according to
their needs. The pilot scheme will be further
extended for three years from March 2020 to
March 2023.

   - A three-year Pilot Scheme on Home Care and
Support for Elderly Persons with Mild
Impairment launched in December 2017 by
the Community Care Fund (CCF)[14], to provide
home care and support services to lowincome seniors with mild impairment. The
scheme targets 4,000 service places would be

the second quarter of 2020.

   - The Community Care Fund also rolled out a
Pilot Scheme on Support for Elderly Persons

**in Elderly and Rehabilitation Care**

The Hong Kong Government has earmarked HK$1
billion to set up “Innovation and Technology Fund for
Application in Elderly and Rehabilitation Care” (I&T
Fund) in December 2018. The objective of this fund
is to subsidise seniors and rehabilitation service units
to procure, rent or trial use technology products, so
as to improve the quality of life of service users as
well as reduce the burden and pressure of care staff
and carers.

The Assessment Panel of the I&T Fund will examine

91

i i


who are in need of transitional care and
support. The scheme aims to provide these
seniors with transitional residential care and/
or community care and support services for a
maximum duration of 6 months. The objective
of the scheme is to enable these individuals to
continue ageing-in-place within a familiar
community after receiving necessary services
during the transitional period and preventing
their premature long-term institutionalisation in
residential care homes for seniors. A total of
3,200 seniors are expected to be supported by
this pilot scheme in three years. The
effectiveness review of the pilot scheme will
be completed in the second quarter of 2020.

**16**

**Enhanced Bought Place Scheme**

SWD had purchased aged care service facilities from
private homes for seniors under the Enhanced
Bought Place Scheme since 1998, with a view to
upgrading the service standard of these homes
through enhanced service requirements in terms of
staffing and space standard. This helped to increase
the supply of subsidised service facilities so as to
reduce seniors’ waiting time for subsidised care-andattention places.

recommends the amount of grants of each
application. In the first tranche, more than
US$4.7million (HK$37 million) funding approved and
this has subsidised more than 210 service facilities to
procure or rent about 870 technology products.

The second tranche of applications which ended on
September 2019, received about 2,300 applications
from more than 650 service facilities, and they are
waiting for the approval result of Assessment Panel.
At the same time, the third tranche was open for
application from February to April 2020.

**Subsidise senior care units to provide soft meal**

In order to help the seniors with dysphagia to enjoy
the meal more safety and with dignity, to ensure
adequate nutrition, to enhance their quality of life and
slow down the rate of decline, the Hong Kong
Government will allocate an additional US$9.7 million
(HK$75 million) to subsidise senior care facilities in
2020/21 to provide soft meals.


There are currently 210 subsidised senior centres in
Hong Kong, including 41 District Elderly Community
Centres and 169 Neighbourhood Elderly Centres, to
provide community support services at district level
and neighbourhood level. A range of comprehensive
services are provided in order to enable seniors to
remain in the community, to lead a healthy, respectful
and dignified life, and to enhance their positive and
contributing role to the society.

Integrated Home Care Services (IHCS) provide a
range of community support services to seniors,
people with disabilities and needy families living in
the community with a pool of experienced and
professionally trained staff, and via network of
service units in the community with its collaboration
and support.

The Integrated Home Care Services Teams provide
care and support to the target service users
according to their individual needs and actualise the
concepts of ageing-in-place and continuum-of-care to
enable the service users to continue living in the
community. There are approximately 16,600 people
who are receiving the home care services and 3,000
people who are on the waiting list for this service.
These services include personal care, rehabilitation
exercise, counselling services, 24-hour emergency
support, respite services, home environment safety

assessment and improvement suggestions,
housekeeping and meal delivery services, etc.

Day Care Centre / Unit for the Elderly (DE/DCU) in
Hong Kong provide a range of centre-based care and
support services during daytime to enable frail
seniors who are suffering from moderate or severe
level of impairment, including seniors with dementia,
to maintain their optimal level of functioning, develop
their potential, improve their quality of life and live in
their own homes wherever feasible and possible. It
also provides various kinds of support and assistance
to the carers in order to enable them to continue to
assume their responsibilities as carers.

As of the end of January 2020, there are 79
daycentres/ service units for the seniors in Hong
Kong, providing 3,383 places. Services include
personal care, nursing services, respite services,
rehabilitation and social activities, and carer support,
etc.

As most seniors prefer to age-in-place,
gerontechnology can play a role in enabling healthy
and independent living of the seniors, as well as
improving the efficiency for senior care services.

As reflected in the Smart City Blueprint for Hong
Kong, the Government will earmark US$130 million
(HK$1 billion) for setting up the Innovation and
Technology Fund for Application in Elderly and
Rehabilitation Care which subsidises senior service

22

units to test and procure technology products. More

cross-sector collaboration is expected with the
support of the Fund to contribute to the development
of more user-friendly tech products for the local
silver-hair market.

**Living facilities**
The Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) had


23

launched a “Senior Citizen Residences Scheme” in

1999 with two pilot projects completed in 2003 and
2004 respectively, which provided residence
integrating housing, recreation, medical and care
service under one roof for the middle-income seniors.
The two pilot projects (“Jolly Place” and “Cheerful
Court”) provided 576 residential units which were
disposed of under a long-lease arrangement, both
senior-friendly housing hardware and skilled care
services software are provided to enable the
residents to enjoy ageing-in-place.

The third project will be developed while the facilities
and design of the new project will be optimised based
on experience with the two completed projects and
feedback from tenants, the construction of the third
project has been commenced with completion
targeted in 2022.

As the Senior Citizen Residences Scheme was
greatly welcomed by the middle class seniors,
proving that the society has a great demand for highquality senior housing projects, HKHS launched a
“Quality Retirement Living Scheme” in 2015 to
develop a senior housing project “The Tanner Hill” to
promote joyous living with premium facilities and
services for seniors who have higher expectation for
a high-quality retirement life and are financially
capable. This self-financing retirement life project
operated by HKHS has a total of 588 independent
living units. As of December 2017, the occupancy

24

rate was approximately 93.8%.

environment to frail seniors whose family members
are unable to provide care during daytime, while
Residential Care Services aims to provide residential
care and facilities for seniors who cannot adequately
be taken care of at home. As of end December 2019,
there were 748 Residential Care Homes for seniors
providing a total of 75,901 places, of which 28,260
were subsidised places. However, the current
demand rates for subsidised aged residential care

40,697 applicants on the waitlist for subsidised
residential care services, and applicants have to wait
for more than three years for a place.

**Ageing Asia Curated Facilities**

**CADENZA**
In view of Hong Kong SAR’s rapidly ageing
populuation, the Hong Kong Jockey Club initiated a
project for the Hong Kong SAR’s seniors. The
project, named CADENZA, is worth HK$380 million,
and is funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club
Charities Trust, with the faculty of Social Sciences of
The University of Hong Kong and the faculty of
Medicine at The Chinese University of Hong Kong as
project partners.

CADENZA aims to create an senior-friendly
community that fosters positive attitude from the
community towards seniors, and continually improves
the quality of care and life for Hong Kong’s seniors.

CADENZA’s community projects are both innovative
and sustainable to cope with the changing needs of
seniors. Each project has an evidence-based
research approach to ‘measure outcome and validate
the effectiveness of the delivery model’.

One of CADENZA’s innovative projects is the Jockey


Club CADENZA Hub located in Tai Po. The Jockey
Club CADENZA Hub is an integrated primary health
and social care centre for ‘the old and the soon-to-beold’. The services include:

   - primary health services covering healthy
lifestyle programmes and professional
consultation

   - chronic conditions management

   - day care service and

   - other services, e.g. Traditional Chinese
Medicine and optometric assessment.

**Cheerful Court**
Cheerful Court is Hong Kong SAR’s first retirement
village - a pilot senior housing project by the Hong
Kong Housing Society. It is a housing estate under
the Hong Kong SAR’s ‘Senior Citizen Residences
Scheme’. Built under the concept of "home with
living support" and "lease for life", Cheerful Court comprising of 254 one- bedroom apartments and 79
studio apartments, is aimed at realising the notion of
"healthy ageing" and "ageing in place", offering
"individual caring, overall concern" servicing
apartments for the middle income seniors.

Apart from the provision of residential units, Cheerful
Court hopes to allow for the inclusion of social and
recreational interaction amongst the residents, so it is
also equipped with Club House facilities, such as
indoor heated pool, Jacuzzi, fitness room, library,
multi-purpose hall, multi-function room, craft and
pottery workshop etc. These ancillary facilities,
located at the podium, served as "software" for the
residents, which offer substantial leisure and health
care services.

In addition, clinical and Chinese Herbalist medical
services, dental and beauty services are also
provided. The whole suite of facilities and services
ensured the Cheerful Court residents are able to live

**KEY CHALLENGES IN THE HONG KONG AGED**
**CARE SECTOR**

The key challenges in the ageing market in Hong
Kong are the scarcity of land and manpower
resources. Studies were conducted to strategically
review the current situation and project
future demand, recommendations were made by
committees to the Government to tackle the root
causes of these shortage issues from multiple
angles.

**Scarcity of Land Resources**
In Hong Kong, it is a densely populated city where a
population of over 7 million is crammed into a mere
1,106 square km of land. The Elderly Service
Programme Plan (ESPP)[25] which envisions future
service demand of the ageing population and make
mid-to-long-term recommendations to the
Government, had recommended the Government to
take into account the need of seniors in urban
planning.

Based on the ESPP recommendation, the
Government stipulated population-based planning
ratios in the Hong Kong Planning Standards and
Guidelines in respect of subsidised residential care
services for the seniors, subsidised community care
services for the seniors, District Elderly Community
Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres in
December 2018 to help reserve appropriate land for
the provision of these seniors services and facilities.

In addition to living space, another important
consideration is to ensure there is sufficient space for
communal space for exercising and primary
healthcare clinics to ensure healthy longevity. The


Government has designated easily accessible
venues in each of the 18 districts in Hong Kong for
District Health Centres or its interim solution – District
Health Express, where seniors, especially those
suffering from chronic illnesses, can seek practical
advice and primary healthcare support from nurses
and allied health professionals.[26]

**Shortage of Healthcare Manpower**
Due to the ageing population and the shrinking labour
force, the issue of manpower shortage in healthcare
and social service industry is escalating. Moreover,
the increasing occurrence of lifestyle-related
diseases and rising expectations for healthcare
services imply a greater need of person-centred care
and case management.

A Steering Committee was established in 2012 to
conduct a strategic review on healthcare manpower
planning and professional development, and a report
was issued in 2019.[27 ]It is projected that there would
be a general shortage of doctors, dentists, dental
hygienists, general nurses, occupational therapists,
physiotherapists, medical laboratory technologists,
optometrists and radiographers.

Regarding manpower supply, the steering committee
proposed five recommendations:

   - increasing the number of subsidised training
places for disciplines likely to face manpower
shortages,

   - giving assistance to self-financing
programmes in conducting training,

   - retaining healthcare professionals to work in
the public sector after retirement,

   - attracting non-locally trained professionals to
practise in Hong Kong, and

98

## 6.Country Overview: Hong Kong S.A.RCountry Overview: Australia

   - conducting manpower planning and
projections every three years.

On professional development and regulation, another
five recommendations were made. They are:

   - enhancing lay involvement in healthcare
professions’ boards and councils

   - recovering the cost of running the boards and
councils,

   - making continuing professional education and
development a mandatory requirement,

   - reviewing the complaint investigation and
disciplinary inquiry mechanism, and

   - regulating healthcare professions that are not
subject to statutory registration.

With these pillars of foundation set in place, it is
imperative that these key challenges are likely to be
addressed, painting a lucrative silver economy.

**OPPORTUNITIES IN AGEING**

Hong Kong’s baby boomer statistics hold much
potential for the ageing population market. The
percentage of baby boomers stands at 30.4% of the
total population, a huge group with high financial

28

capabilities. This cohort of seniors born from 1946 –

1965 will remain the largest when becoming “youngolds” in about 5 to 10 years’ time, and finally to above
80 in the future where their expectations and
demands for senior housing and care would drive the
silver economy landscape of the coming years.

There are many reasons pertaining to the affluence
of this consumer group. They are largely financially
independent through their own savings and assets. In


addition, support from their children is viewed as a
surplus. In a survey conducted by Consumer Council,
it was noted that vast majority of ageing consumers
in Hong Kong (71.7%) agreed that there were
insufficient choices in the market to cater to their

29

needs.

Seniors are now much fitter, better-educated and
better-informed than the preceding generation. They
are now more interested to spend in an age-friendly
consumer environment. There is a gap for investors,
operators and entrepreneurs to address these needs
and reap the benefits of the silver market.

**OVERVIEW**

India’s economy is the fastest growing trillion-dollar
economy and fifth largest in the world, accounting for

1

3.3% of the world’s GDP.


Due to the global pandemic crisis, India is expected
to enter into a recession, with a negative 4.5% in the
GDP for 2020 to US$2.7 trillion as forecasted by the
IMF as compared to US$2.8 trillion in 2019. The
economy will have a good recovery of 6% in 2021

2

with an increase to US$2.86 trillion. India’s GDP Per

Capita was US$2,010 in 2018 and is forecasted to be
US$1,961 in 2020 and US$2,441 in 2025.


India has a population of over 1.38 billion, with 139
million or 10.1% of the population aged 60 and above

3

in 2020. The number of Indians aged 60 and above

will be expected to more than double over the next 30
years, at 320 million or 19.5% of the total population.
The ageing population is second largest after China.

programmes would be required to support this group
to age with lesser health complications.

The remaining 40% of the ageing population would
be the group that have a longer life expectancy than
the general population and this group may require
higher care as they age, such as assisted living,
homecare or nursing care.

In 2020, there are more than 5 million people living
with dementia in India and this number is projected to
double in 2040. By 2050, the number of people living

6

with dementia is projected at 14.3 million. Globally,

India has second highest number of individuals living
with dementia.

_Source: Dementia India Strategy Report (2018). Alzheimer’s and_

_Related Disorder Society of India._


The prevalence rate of dementia in India varies
greatly from 1% to 10% across studies. There are
two plausible explanations, the first being the
diversity of the population being studied and the
difference in methodology utilised. Prevalence rates
are found to be higher in rural populations with low
awareness of dementia, where they are less likely to

8

report prevalence even when evidence is present.

As noted by Alzheimer’s and Related Disorder
Society of India (ARDSI) report in 2018, dementia
services have been scarce and limited in India. There
are officially 15 registered day care centres, 12
residential senior care facilities, six home care
services, 100 memory clinics and 10 dementia
helplines. This can be seen from the number of
cases diagnosed, at 10%. There is a need for
community education, services and facilities to help
address this issue. Innovative product and services
related to supporting people with dementia will be a
key focus within India’s ageing industry. With the
number expected to grow exponentially, it is
imperative for the gap to be addressed.

**INDUSTRY OUTLOOK**


There is a lack of information on research regarding
economic and social burden of dementia in India. In
2010, the household cost of caring for a person living
with dementia, based on the stage of the disease, is
projected between US$615 to US$2,732 in urban

7

areas and US$274 to US$891. With the number of

people living with dementia projected to increase
significantly, along with the economic growth and
inflation, this would impact the economic costs of
dementia significantly too.


In India, the traditional culture with joint families and
sharing of common land holding implies that seniors
are taken care of by family members, usually women.
However, with rapid urbanisation and economic
growth, there is a sizeable social change. With fewer
children, more women joining the workforce and rise
of nuclear families, seniors are increasingly being left

9

to take care of themselves. This has made the

context of senior living, assistive products and senior
care facilities increasingly relevant in India’s aged
care sector.

Those aged 60 and above in India have been living

healthier and longer lives as compared to their
predecessors whose life expectancy was 60 years in
1994. This is aided by continuous economic growth
and better access to healthcare facilities. This trend
is expected to continue for the next few decades in
line with the projection of the increasing ageing
population.

With longer life expectancy, they are able to remain
engaged in the community or in the workforce and
have higher purchasing power. It was estimated that
45% of India’s urban seniors fall into the top three
wealth quintiles. This forms a large group of seniors
who are independent and economically active. As of
2019, this segment of senior spends over US$806
million on lifestyle products and offers an overall

10

market size of US$1.49 billion.

Senior living market in India caters for the population
aged 55 and above, which is much younger age limit
as compared to the other countries in the region. The
residents are usually without any major health issues
and are able to take care of themselves. There are
also assisted living options and nursing homes for
those who need higher care to residential care
services.

The silver sector is expected to evolve into a
significant stand-alone market servicing millions of
seniors in a variety of lifestyle products and services,
health maintenance and management products and
services, aged care services, and senior living
facilities.

Trends towards home care, senior living and
assistive technological products will accelerate and
the new generation of baby boomers, with a greater
financial capacity, will accelerate the growth of the
industry.


**National Policy on Older Persons (NPOP)**

12

The formulation of the NPOP in 1999, will look

towards state support in providing financial security,
food, healthcare and basic necessities of seniors.
Additionally, the policy aims to protect seniors
against abuse and exploitation, while providing
seniors with an availability of services to improve
their quality of life.

costs for seniors, mainly hospitalisation expenses.
There is an option to cover critical illness treatment
expenses or pre-existing diabetes and hypertension.
The policy is eligible for purchase for seniors who are
60 years to 80 years of age. The policy term is a year
and can be renewed up till when the policy holder is
90 years of age. The sum insured for hospitalisation
and home care expenses is up to US$1,350 and for

treatment required, up to a maximum of 20%.

**Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY)**
The RSBY scheme was launched on 1 April 2008 by
the Government of India. The aim of the scheme is to
provide health insurance coverage to seniors who
are BPL. The scheme will ultimately help these
families in dealing with financial liabilities that may
arise due to health issues.

**National Program of Health Care for Elderly**
**(NPHCE)**
The National Program of Health Care for Elderly
(NPHCE) launched in 2010, aims to provide senior
care facilities through primary, secondary and tertiary
healthcare delivery systems. The network will consist
of community hospitals, with regional medical
institutions as support for reference.

**DEVELOPMENT OF ELDERCARE SERVICES &**
**SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES**

The demand for aged care services, senior care
facilities and senior living options is forecasted to
increase largely due to India’s rapidly ageing
population, along with the mindset shift of seniors


With an increasing number of seniors choosing to live
independently in a senior-friendly environment with
personalised care, senior living will grow alongside
innovative home care developments. The options
chosen by the seniors will depend on their functional
capability and expectations. There are currently
20,000 senior living units in India. However, only 55%
of these units are operational and the rest are under
construction. The current demand is at 240,000 units
and will be projected to grow over 900,000 over the
next 10 years. The huge demand will be an

19

opportunity for investors and operators to meet.

The demand for specialised geriatric workers,
nurses, healthcare professionals and caregivers will
boom as India’s ageing population will require
healthcare services to support them in managing
their chronic disease and other age-related health
issues. The shortage of these healthcare
professionals needs to be addressed.

i i


who are more willing to stay alone or be independent
from their children, in addition to the increased
financial capacity to spend.

As informal support declines due to social changes in
the population including the migration of the younger
population to the cities, there will be a need for home
care for the seniors, particularly those staying alone.
In a report by CII, the India home healthcare market
is valued at US$2.3 billion. The market is expected to
grow at 18% per annum, with 25 – 30% of the market
being contributed by seniors. The growth of home
care is in line with global trends, where improvement
in healthcare technologies and better integration
between hospital and home care services contribute
to this growth. The focus of home care support
services is divided to clinical services and custom-fit

18

senior services in the future.

**KEY CHALLENGES IN THE INDIA AGED CARE**
**SECTOR**

Attitudes towards geriatrics is a major challenge in
India’s aged care sector. As a relatively new sector,
there are negative attitudes in accepting geriatrics as
a professional career. This is mainly due to limited


Another challenge would be barriers in entering the
senior living market. As an emerging sector, majority
of Indian developers lack the expertise and
knowledge in accessing the market. As such, they
tend to prefer general population housing projects.
There is an opportunity for foreign investors and
developers to enter the market and fill the gap
created by the increased demand.

The lack of policies in the senior living market has

i i


awareness, knowledge and interaction towards the

21

industry.

Geriatric care is not included in the medical
education curriculum, and nursing and paramedical
staff members are not provided with formal training in
caring for senior patients. There is little to no
specialised training in geriatrics across medical
schools. Key facilities with a geriatric department are
few and expensive, concentrated mostly in urban
areas. The government will need to focus on building
human resource capacity through specialisation and
training opportunities, to meet the demand in aged

22

care that is bound to increase in the coming years.


India’s aged care sector recorded a relatively low
expenditure for healthcare. According to National
Health Profile (NHP) data in 2018, India only spends
1.28% of its GDP on public health expenditure,
compared to an average of 5% - 10% in countries
such as Singapore and Australia. The cost of
treatment for healthcare has been on the rise in India
and if not addressed, a barrier to healthcare services

23

may arise. The government aims to increase

healthcare expenditure to 2.5% of GDP in 2025. As
such, there is a room to further enhance the
healthcare services. The healthcare market size in
India is expected to increase three-fold to US$133.4

24

billion in 2022.

## Country Overview: India

impeded the growth of the market as well. As the
government has not given senior living recognition as
a priority segment, no benefits have been provided to
the senior-specific project development. The
government need to consider providing some
incentive and subsidy for senior living projects to
actively attract more players in the market, including

25

foreign entities.

**OPPORTUNITIES IN AGEING**

With continuous economic growth and a rapidly
ageing population, the aged care industry in India is
expected to increase in market size exponentially
and will become a significant contributor to the
country’s GDP. Senior living options, i.e. independent
living, assisted living and nursing option would be in
demand to meet the different needs of the seniors
aged 55 and above.

More collaboration by the government across public,
private and community sectors will be required to
drive the industry forward, in addition to more
definitive and comprehensive policies to support this
sector to enable its growth to cater to the changing
needs of the ageing population. As India experience
longer life expectancy, the demand for healthcare
and health management programmes will increase to
enable seniors to age well and live longer.

The number of senior consumers aged 60 and above
will reach 319 million by 2050 which will make India
the second largest silver market in Asia Pacific, just
behind China. With a shortage of senior living units,
aged care services and an ever-growing demand,
there is a large market for both local and foreign
investors, developers and operators to explore and
cater the varied products and services to the ageing
population in India.

## 6.Country Overview: IndonesiaCountry Overview: Australia

In a study by Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OESO), Indonesia is
one of the developing countries facing a demographic
transition. Even though the country still have a young
and large population, with median age estimated at
28.6 years in 2016, the decreasing birth rate and
rising senior population positions Indonesia towards

6

an ageing nation. The economic old-age

dependency ratio will rise from 10.5 in 2019 to 15.6

7

by 2030. Life mortality at birth is currently 71.70

8 9

years and healthy life expectancy at 61.66 years.


As one of the Asia countries presenting the largest
number of seniors in Southeast Asia, frailty has
become a major health problem among Indonesian
seniors bringing an increase in the risk of important
health outcomes in seniors such as falls,
hospitalisation, disability, poor health-related quality

10

of life, nutrition, age-related diseases and mortality.

The OESO remarked that it is the right time for
Indonesia to prepare for a future ageing population.
According to Indonesia’s population projections,
Indonesia is expected to experience ageing
population in 2021. This infers the start of lower
labour-force participation and lower savings rates, as
well as the likely possibility of slowing economic
growth. This means that the cost of health care will
increase too.


Health care service for senior patients in Indonesia
has developed rapidly since the government issued a
regulation in 2014 regarding senior patients’ services
in hospitals. The regulation arranged for each
hospital to have special senior patients’ services.
Seniors in Indonesia are defined as those aged
60 years and above. There are 15 government
hospitals that provide senior patients’ services in
Indonesia in accordance with the rules contained in

11

the regulation.


The policy also ensues geriatric training for health
providers at geriatric units in the major provisional

12

hospitals primarily in Java island. Programme on

counseling for seniors are also available in
age-friendly health centres. The Government also
started to develop more home care programmes
across the country in an effort to prepare and create
an age-friendly environment that promotes healthy

13

senior citizens and active participation of seniors.

**INDUSTRY OUTLOOK**

Indonesia has been experiencing population
structural changes in the last few decades due to the
successful community-based family planning
programme in the 1970s. At the same time,
Indonesia is heading towards an ageing population.

14

Based on the Population Projection of 2015 - 2045,

Indonesia is forecasted to experience an ageing
population by 2021. In 2019, only a few provinces
that experienced ageing, including Yogyakarta,
Special Autonomous Region (SAR), East Java,
Central Java, Bali, and South Sulawesi.

In 2045, celebrating 100 years of the country’s
independence, almost all provinces in Indonesia are
predicted to reach the state of an ageing population.
Within the next 20 years from now, is a critical time
for the Indonesian government to develop a set of
policies that is responsive towards addressing the
need of the seniors.

Population ageing and increasing life expectancy
have some implications. Poverty and the lack of
income security among the seniors are one of the
biggest challenges. Based on the National SocioEconomic Survey (Susenas) of 2019, about 2.9

i i

4[th] Asia Pacific Silver Economy
Business Opportunities Report
2020 Edition


## 6.Country Overview: IndonesiaCountry Overview: Australia

million people aged 60 and above, live below the

15

national poverty line. This implies a poverty rate of

11.2% among the seniors, higher than the national
poverty rate of 9.4%.

Furthermore, Indonesian women live longer than
men by a difference of about four years. This is a
challenge faced by the Government as senior
females are more likely to live alone and in poverty,
compared to their male counterparts. In 2019, the
poverty rate among older women was 11.8%, higher
than the poverty rate of older men of 10.3%.

Currently, less than 50% of Indonesian seniors have
a secure income support. In fact, based on 2019
data, about 49.3% of seniors were still actively
working (Older People Population Statistics,
Statistics Indonesia 2019).


Based on Susenas 2019, only about 10.5% of the

8

ageing population received pension income. Most of

them had a formal job before and belonged to the
higher socioeconomic group. About 27.4% of all
seniors received some sort of regular social
assistance from the central and local governments,
including the food subsidy (Program Sembako) and
the conditional cash transfer (Program Keluarga
_Harapan - PKH)._

In terms of health insurance, 69.7% of the Indonesian
seniors are covered by at least a type of health
insurance. Most of them obtained coverage through
the highly-subsidised National Health Insurance
Program (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional).

A small proportion of the Indonesian seniors
experienced difficulties in conducting daily living
activities. Based on the 2018 Indonesia Basic Health
Research, about 25.7% of seniors experienced mild
disabilities, and 3.7% experienced moderate to total


16

disabilities. The risk factors of seniors with

disabilities included degenerative diseases, such as
diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart diseases,
arthritis, trauma, and dementia.

The number of people who have dementia in
Indonesia has increased rapidly and is expected to
reach 1.9 million in 2030 and nearly 4 million in 2050
(Indonesian Alzheimer Diseases Data).

A 2016 study shows that the prevalence of dementia
in the Yogyakarta SAR, one of the regions with the
highest proportion of seniors, reached 20.1% of the
total seniors. These senior groups would potentially
need long term care (LTC), a system that is yet to be

17

developed in the country.

From end 2019 - 2020, the Government has started
SILANI, a pilot of an information system collecting the
individual data of the senior and their needs,
according to Dr Maliki, Director for Population
Planning and Social Protection, Ministry of National
Development Planning (Bappenas). This mini census
managed to collect information of almost 15,000
seniors in seven villages in the Jakarta Special
Capital Region (SCR), Bali, and Yogyakarta SAR.


Based on SILANI, about 9.7% of the seniors in these
regions needed care, of which 58% were senior
females. Around 55.6% of the seniors did not need
LTC but experienced some difficulties in conducting
their daily activities, while the rest (34.7%) did not
have any problems in doing their routines.

If SILANI’s findings are generalisable, this would
mean that approximately 2.5 million seniors will
require LTC. This number will potentially increase
significantly every year. SILANI’s results also show
that 11.9% of seniors who needed LTC never had a
caregiver, and 78.9% had their family members as

i i

## 6.Country Overview: IndonesiaCountry Overview: Australia

their caregivers. This finding suggests a shortage of
both caregiver supply and LTC programmes,
indicating a considerable potential market in health
and social care such as home care, nursing homes,
as well as other goods and services related to LTC
activities.

**GOVERNMENT POLICIES & INITIATIVES**

The government policies on the seniors and
population ageing are mentioned in several
governmental documents, including the National
Medium-Term Development Plan 2020-2024 and the
National Strategy for the Elderly. In both documents,
the government commits to the protection of seniors’
rights, including receiving adequate social protection
and access to income security. The government also
encourages line ministries and local governments to
transform their programmes to be more inclusive

18

toward the seniors.

The SILANI pilot was a follow-up implementation of
the National Strategy for the Elderly. The pilot will be
developed to be a national information system, which
supports policymakers with information on the
seniors’ needs. Additionally, the government also
provides subsidy for seniors who are less well-to-do
and the Ministry of Health conducts a senior health
care programmes hosted in the community health
centres.

These government initiatives could lead to the
improvement of ageing market. The conditional cash
transfer programme requires senior beneficiaries to
attend some sort of social service. The social
rehabilitation programme provides institutional- and
community-based senior care as well as small
business training (only to the active senior). The
community health centres offer specifically tailored


Additionally, the Ministry of Health has issued a
guideline for Puskesmas to provide long term care.
The guideline aims to support Puskesmas in
providing home care for seniors as well as improving
the community capacity to provide senior care. The
beneficiaries of this programme include the senior
themselves and caregivers who are the community
members or local organisations that provide senior

20

care.

The Ministry of Social Affairs conducts several
programmes for seniors, including the PKH
conditional cash transfer and senior living
facilities/nursing homes, in total covering about 1.5
million seniors with low socioeconomic status. The
nursing homes are mostly owned and fully funded by

i i


health care for seniors. These activities need
supplies of senior care providers, including the senior
care facilities, social workers, geriatric nurses, and
accredited training programmes.

**DEVELOPMENT OF ELDERCARE SERVICES &**
**SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES**

There have been some initiatives from line ministries
to expand senior care. Due to the lack of the
availability of senior living facilities, the actions are
mostly community-based. The Ministry of Health
conducts a programme called Posyandu Lansia, or
Integrated Health Services for the Elderly. Posyandu
_Lansia primarily offers and promotes preventive_
health care, which may include medical check-up and
physical exercise. This programme is conducted
periodically at the village level and managed by
facilitators who are members of the community.
Health workers from nearby community health
centres (Puskesmas) usually also support the

19

programme.


115

## 6.Country Overview: IndonesiaCountry Overview: Australia

the central and provincial governments. These
facilities can be accessed for free, but admission
depends on local government recommendations.
Some nursing homes also conduct senior care
programmes in the community and provide social
assistance to both the senior and caregivers through
their social workers and networks of local senior care
organisations.

The National Agency for Population and Family
Planning conducts a family-based empowerment
programme geared toward families with senior
members called Bina Keluarga Lansia (BKL) or
Elderly Family Development. This programme trains
community facilitators who provide home care to the
seniors and caregiving capacity development to
families with seniors. The community facilitators
usually also manage the Posyandu Lansia.

To coordinate all the initiatives and expand the
coverage of senior care, the Ministry of Development
Planning (Bappenas) conducts the LTC and senior
care pilot. During 2019 - 2020, SILANI has been
developed as a prototype of the information system
of the ageing population, which will provide
information on LTC and other senior care needs in
the community. In the following years, based on
SILANI, Bappenas will continue piloting LTC and
other senior care programmes and developing the
plan to expand the initiatives, involve private
providers, and establish a more sustainable financing
mechanism.

While the government provides most of the senior
care and support, there are some initiatives from
organisations and private sectors. NGOs and
community-based organisations offer senior living
facilities and home care for poorer seniors. There are
some private self-funded nursing homes for the
seniors who can afford to cover the expenses. Some


NGOs and health service companies also provide
geriatric caregiving training for caregivers.

**OVERVIEW OF FACILITIES IN INDONESIA**

The government has committed to prioritising the
ageing population needs in the coming years, as
stated in the formal planning documents. There are a
number of current initiatives aimed at providing better
access to senior care. The conditional cash transfer
(PKH) programme, which covers near to 1.5 million
seniors who are poor, requires the beneficiaries to
access a type of senior care provided by social
workers, government care facilities, or local seniors
NGOs. There have been indications of shortages of
service availability, implying a room for private
providers to fill the gap.

The SILANI pilot will also include options for a more
sustainable senior care financing mechanism. If the
initiatives expand nationally, the market and industry
for senior care services and facilities would also
expand to cater for the increasing demand and
accessibility to such services.

the risks and symptoms are.

Further training in treatment of people with dementia
was conducted by Alzheimer Indonesia, followed by
training for health workers in community health
centres (puskesmas) and related local government
staff in Gianyar district.

Ketewel village officials supported the project by
reviving integrated health services for the seniors
(posyandu lansia), introducing nutritious food
subsidies, and organising group activities for the

**KEY CHALLENGES IN INDONESIA AGED CARE**
**SECTOR**

The biggest challenge for the seniors’ welfare and
ageing industry in Indonesia is the large informal
sector economy. It is challenging for the social
security system to provide comprehensive coverage
to the informal sector employees. This means those
engaged in the informal sector would seldom have a
pension or other insurance funding to cover the care
they may need when they retire. Most Indonesians
still think that their family will take care of them when
they age, however, this situation may change as
society that becomes more modern and
individualistic, even for Indonesia.

For the ageing market, this implies that while the
needs of senior care workers and facilities is
imminent, the seniors may not have enough
purchasing power to demand the services
professionally. The family will be the ones who
provide senior care, i.e. act as the caregiver.

This situation, if not improved, will affect the
economy. Without sufficient coverage of
comprehensive social insurance, government
spending on social assistance for seniors will
increase. The productivity of the school and workingage population will also be compromised as they
have to leave the education system or the workforce,
in order to take care of their older family members.

The next challenge is the readiness of the supply of
aged care services. Currently, the availability and
quality of senior care programmes in Indonesia are
inadequate. Other than through family members,
most of the senior care is provided by the
government and not-for-profit organisations. In view
of the perceived low demand, private sector
involvement in the provision of senior care is still


limited. This situation will need to be improved
simultaneously with the government’s initiatives to
increase coverage of social care for seniors,
including through better financing mechanisms.

**OPPORTUNITIES IN AGEING**

The silver report forecasts that the ageing market
boom for Asia Pacific countries will happen in the
next ten years.

As observed in the Age Group Income chart,
Indonesians within the age group of 50-54 to 55-59
have the highest income level and purchasing power.
Within the next five to ten years time, this group
would be part of the ageing population. With the
wealthiest age segment age, the consumer spending
for those aged above 60 can be expected to rise
exponentially, along with the demand and higher
expectations of certain product and services to
support their needs.

Additionally, by 2030, the number of over 60
consumers in Indonesia would be doubled to 41
million and this number would increase by 70% to 70
million by 2050, surpassing even Japan by the sheer
ageing population number.

This will make Indonesia’s the third largest silver
market surpassing Japan, after China and India
respectively. With the escalating need to provide
sufficient living alternatives and services, there is a
huge opportunity for operators, developers and
investors to tap into Indonesia’s growing seniors
living and aged care market.

The seniors living market potential in Indonesia need
to be evaluated based on the driving forces in
consumer spending. With the wide gap of wealth

distribution amongst the seniors, the opportunity lies
in having the attitude of delivering a five-star service.

Private providers can consider collaborating with the
government to provide social housing for seniors, or
to segment the market towards affordable housing for
seniors, affordable luxury housing for seniors or
premium luxury housing for seniors.

The most important value in delivering seniors
housing is the attitude towards providing a home for
life for the seniors with supportive services to enable
successful ageing. The future of seniors housing for
Indonesia can take an aspirational approach with
developers looking at launching multiple price tier
communities. In Japan, companies like SOMPO and
Bennasse create seniors housing and care across
multiple brands and price tiers.

**OVERVIEW**

Japan is the world’s 3rd largest economy, with GDP

1

forecasted to be US$5 trillion in 2019. Due to the

global pandemic crisis, Japan’s GDP is forecasted to
experience recession with negative growth of 5.8%
this year to US$4.7 trillion. The economy is
forecasted to recover in 2021 at a slower pace, with a

2

projected 2.4% growth to US$4.8 trillion.


GDP Per Capita reported for 2018 was at US$39,290
and is forecasted to decrease to US$37,510 in 2020,
but is projected to recover in 2021. Based on our


forecast using a 6-year CAGR (2015 – 2021), we
estimated the GDP will increase to US$41,751 in
2025.

Japan has a population of over 125 million, with over
43.1 million or 34.3% of the population aged 60 and

3

above. Japan is known as the country with the

greatest ageing population in the world, it was
highlighted that the number of Japanese aged over
65 is above 28% and will be set to increase by 10%
to more than 38% in 40 years according to a report
generated by the Government of Japan Cabinet

Based on Japan government revised definition of
seniors to be 75 years and above, in 2020 this age
group account for 42% of the ageing population and
by 2050, it increased to 54% of the ageing
population.

In recent studies on frailty and dementia, 80 years old
is considered the turning point for seniors in Japan,
as these two conditions are more prevalent for
seniors aged 80 and above.

As observed from the ageing population chart, the
number of seniors aged 80 and above is the largest
group of seniors in Japan. This number is set to
increase from 11.3 million in 2020 to 16.8 million in
2050.

With a larger population of the old-old, there would be
increasing demand to support the quality of life and
health-related issues impacting this group, and in
most cases, higher care such as 24 hours residential/
nursing care may be required.


Based on a recent research (Prevalence of frailty in

8

Japan: A systematic review and meta-analysis), the

findings showed that the prevalence of frailty
amongst seniors start to decline more drastically from
aged 80 and above for both sexes.

Older women frailty is more prevalent from age 75
and above, where the prevalence jumped almost


Additionally, life expectancy at birth for 2020 is

5

reported to be 84.67 years and healthy life

6

expectancy is at 74.81 years. Due to the difference

of ten years, we can extrapolate that assistance
would be required, either in the form of tele-health
monitoring, medical and health management
programmes, assisted living services or nursing care
as the individual health status reduces.

The healthcare cost per capita in 2017 was
US$4,169, and we forecast it will increase to

7

US$4,840 in 2025.

threefold from 3.8% in the age group 70 – 74 to
10.1% for age group 75 – 79, and further decline to
22.3% and 37.2% in the later age groups. The
society need to be prepared to address frailty related
health issues amongst older women ageing
population at an earlier age as compared to older
men whose frailty is more prevalent from age 80 and
above.

This further substantiates the need for health-related
services and higher-care as the population shifts
towards an increase in the old-old ageing population.
Frailty will impede mobility and independence
amongst the seniors, and in some cases is one of the
key causes of falls amongst seniors. Health
prevention programme and activities, such as

strength and balance training should be encouraged.
This enables the seniors to keep active and minimise
the decline in their muscle mass and muscle strength
due to sarcopenia.

**Dementia in Japan**
In 2020, there is an estimate of 6 million (17.2%)
people in Japan with dementia in Japan. This figure
is set to increase to 6.75 million (19%) by 2025, 7.44
million (20.8%) by 2030, and 8 million (21.4%) by

age group, and more prevalent amongst older
women compared to older men.

The likelihood of seniors with dementia increase
significantly from age 80 and above, and 71.8% of
older women aged 90 and above have dementia as

11

compared to 42.4% in older men. Innovative

product and services related to supporting people
with dementia continue to be one of the key focus
areas within the ageing industry.

Based on the data from prevalence of frailty and
prevalence of dementia, the age 80 seem to indicate
the point when a senior is most likely to experience
the significant decline in his or her health and wellbeing status. In this situation, the society need to be
prepared to address the needs of this old-old ageing
population in Japan.

**INDUSTRY OUTLOOK**

With the highest proportion of people aged 60 and
above in the world, this has driven Japan to be the
world’s first silver economy. Being the forefront of a
super-aged nation, Japan has set a precedent for the
future of ageing globally. The proportion of seniors
aged above 60 is 34.3% in 2020 and is set to rise to
43.8% in 2050.

Faced with the huge demographic shift, Japan’s
ageing workforce will slow down the economy and
strain Japan’s established pension system. As a
countermeasure, the government has taken a multiprong approach in boosting economic growth. In
2000, Japan implemented a comprehensive longterm care insurance that pays for governmentapproved care plans that offer seniors a care model
of their choice. This can range from staying in
assisted living facilities, home care to assistive


century where seniors have become a large

i i


mobility devices. Since 2011, the government has
been improving care plans by expanding care models

12

to be more holistic.

One of the key social reforms by Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe is encouraging seniors to work and stay
active in the workforce, to address the gap caused by
an ageing and shrinking population. Japan’s primary
working population is currently 75.45 million and is
forecasted to decline to 68.75 million in 2030. As
active seniors continue working, this would help to
reduce the gap in the declining workforce. The
number of working seniors has increased by more
than three million over the past decade. They now
account for 13% of the labour force, which is about
one in four seniors.

With seniors continue to be employed in the
workforce, other than supporting the productivity of
the country, this would also help to keep these
seniors healthy and both physically and mentally fit
as they advance in age. While the legislation works
towards securing job opportunities for the seniors, a
system to ensure a secure and safe working

13

environment is being discussed.

The Japanese government has spurred the creation
of aged-care industries by tapping into Japan’s
advantage as one of the world’s technological
leaders. Facing a projected shortfall of workers due
to an ageing population, the Japan government has
been providing funding for the development of aged
care robots and automation.


**GOVERNMENT POLICIES & INITIATIVES**

**Social Security Reform**
Japan’s population demographic has changed from a

th st

young population in the 19 century to the 21


125


-----

4[th] Asia Pacific Silver Economy
Business Opportunities Report
2020 Edition


## 6.Country Overview: JapanCountry Overview: Australia

component of the population, due to longer life
expectancy years and lower birth rates. In order to fit
this demographic shift, the Japan government had to
implement the social security reform.

One of the example of reforms include the policy
recommendation issued by the Japan Geriatrics
Society and Gerontological Society, to change the
definition of seniors from over 65 to over 75. This is
to reflect the reality of the physical fitness of the
seniors in Japan. In 2017, Japan’s dependency ratio
was calculated to be 1:2.1, however with the revised
definition, the ratio increases to 1:5.1.

The recommendation also reflects the increase in
senior working population in Japan. While Japan’s
population has reduced by two million in the last ten
years, the working population actually increased by
2.6 million due to an increase in senior working

14

population.

**Japan’s Dementia Policy**
Following up from its ‘Five-year Plan for Promotion of
Measures against Dementia’ (Orange Plan) in 2013,
Japan has set out a New Orange Plan, the revised
version announced on 27 January 2015. The
dementia plan has seven pillars, comprising of six
measures provisions and one principal provision.


The principal provision – prioritise the perspectives of
people with dementia and their families has the
highest prioritisation compared to the other six
measures. This provision focuses on providing the
opportunity to people with dementia and their families
to be involved in meetings with national government
and local governments, and community-building

15

activities.

The six measures provisions are:

   - **Public awareness and personal advocacy**


**support**

This pillar aims to spread awareness by
setting up awareness events during the month
and day of International Alzheimer’s Day.
Japan targets to reach 12 million dementia
supporters for corporate and industry by 2020,
to increase by another 4 million dementia
supporters in 2025.

All municipalities are expected to disseminate
information of dementia-related consultation
with a target of 10% and 20% increase in
awareness for dementia residents and their
supporters respectively. Ambassadors of
dementia will be established where all
prefectures will be expected to establish their
own ambassadors as well as to implement
peer support system to facilitate personal
support for dementia residents.

 - **Provide healthcare and long-term care**
**services in a timely and at the appropriate**
**level**

This pillar aims to ensure that the level of
healthcare and long-term care services
provided to the persons with dementia are
appropriate based on the stages of dementia
progression, with specific focus on early
diagnosis and prevention. This pillar is to
replace the system that had responded to the
Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of
Dementia (BPSD) and dementia with
hospitalisation or nursing homes.

 - **Reinforce measures for early-onset**
**dementia**

This pillar focuses on assisting people with
early-onset dementia as they may face
obstacles in maintaining their employment or
performing daily living activities. Assistance

provide include counselling services for the
persons with early-onset dementia and their
families, and support for the families,
caregiver and employers of these people with
early-onset of dementia.

   - **Caregiver support**

This pillar focuses on to reducing the physical
and mental burdens placed on caregivers with
the hope, that such support will have a
positive impact on the quality of life of the
persons with dementia. Caregivers are
usually stressed out with managing and caring
for dementia patients, therefore the focus on
providing support to caregivers are timely to
enable a sustainable state of mind of these
carers.

   - **Senior-friendly Communities**
This pillar focus on building communities that

are friendly to seniors, including seniors with
dementia, where systems are setup to better
quality of life through support provided for
daily living and building comfortable
environment to enable seniors to age well.

   - **Research and development,**
**industrialisation, and international**
**outreach**

This pillar aims to promote research and
development to support the full lifecycle of
dementia, from prevention, early diagnosis,
cures, rehabilitation and care. An example is
the initiative to develop biomarkers for
dementia and establishing an effectiveness
indicator for technologies, service, equipment,
etc. that staves off dementia and cognitive
degradation. This will be achieved through
clinical trials for Japanese dementia drug
research as well as establishing clinical trial


response teams.

**Health and Productivity Management (H&PM)**
The data gathered by Dr Hiroko Akiyama of the
University of Tokyo on seniors, suggested that health
status at 65 is a strong indication of quality of life for
the rest of life. In the 70-year-lifespan model, where
people die in their 60s or 70s, health is not as big an
issue for working-age people; in the 100-year
lifespan model, one should continuously invest in
one’s health from as early as possible to maintain
one’s health after retirement.

In addition to traditional occupational health
approach, a public-private partnership programme
called Health and Productivity Management (H&PM)
launched six years ago in Japan. It encourages
CEOs and company management to invest on a
voluntary basis in their employees' health for
productivity and creativity purposes. The return of
that investment is healthier employees with energy
and enthusiasm and better evaluations from the
labour market, capital markets, customers and
society, all of which improves the value of the
company. Now, more than 2,300 large companies
and 35,000 SMEs in Japan have implemented
H&PM.

**Healthcare Innovation Hub**
The Japanese government established “Healthcare
Innovation Hub” in June of 2019. It aims to fill the
connection / collaboration gaps amongst academia,
business, medical professions, NGOs and
governments. For example, while a senior care home
has good contact with local social welfare
communities, it has few opportunities to be with
foreign businesses. While ordinally medical doctors
have good communication with pharmaceutical
companies, they have little collaboration with IT
businesses.

127

## 6.Country Overview: JapanCountry Overview: Australia

The Hub act as a cornerstone among different
sectors, institutions and communities. There are
currently 119 institutions involved, including financial
institutions, consulting firms, insurance firms,
universities, pharmaceutical businesses, IT
businesses, industrial groups, and the central or local
government. The membership is open to foreign
organisations and the Hub, together with Japan’s
global events such as the Well Aging Society
Summit, is a good point of contact for foreign
institutions that have interests in healthcare
innovation in Japan.

**DEVELOPMENT OF ELDERCARE SERVICES &**
**SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES**
Japan is the first country in the world to be dubbed as
a “super aged” society. Japan’s over-75 population is
set to increase from 16 million in 2015 to 21 million in

16

2025. With declining birth rate, household sizes are

shrinking and a huge proportion of seniors are living
alone. New housing and healthcare options have
sprung up to help these seniors maintain healthy,
safe and independent.


2017, early approval system for innovation in medical
devices was introduced and approval period for
products were reduced. Japan’s ageing society has
shown a global trend where longevity is connected to

18

future business prospects.

With a rapidly ageing society, medical costs are
bound to increase as seniors will live with comorbidity in their later years. Japan has turned to
their technological expertise in addressing these
healthcare needs. In 2016, Japan’s revitalisation
strategy capitalised on modern innovations in the
form of big data, Internet Of Things (IOT) and
artificial intelligence. Through these technologies, the
Japanese government hopes to enhance its nursing
care, treatment development and diagnosis

19

support.


The business opportunity presented has been taken
up by domestic investors and entrepreneurs alike,
where they enter the aged care sector at a rapid
pace. As evident of the rapid pace of growth, capacity
in the private senior housing sector has been
booming since 2011. The market has expanded to
over 160% in 2018. Public senior housing, however,

17

has grown by 19% since 2011.

Japan is the second largest single-country
pharmaceutical market at 13%, as of March 2018
and is expected to grow exponentially. Ever since
Japan transformed the market through deregulation
and international free trade deals, foreign businesses
have future opportunities in investing in healthcare. In


The global market for nursing care and disabled aids
robot is US$19.2 million in 2016. However, the
Ministry Of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of
Japan forecasted that the domestic industry alone for
nursing care and disabled aid robots will grow to
US$3.8 billion by 2035. Since 2015, METI has been
promoting development, providing US$45 million in

20

subsidies.


The Japanese government has invested a hefty
US$100 million to create ten artificial intelligencebased hospitals in the healthcare industry by 2022.
With all these initiatives, Japan is poised to reinvent
their healthcare system, creating more opportunities

21

for investment in the healthcare market.

**OVERVIEW OF FACILITIES IN JAPAN**

seniors housing units, of which have expanded
greatly over the past decade.

As seen from the table above, the total capacity of
the publicly funded facilities is slightly above one
million, whereas private operators provide a total

amount of 940,000 spots. Private operators’


participation in the senior housing facilities have
increased significantly from 2011 – 2018, and is
expected to increase further with the demand from
the growing ageing population, particularly from the
seniors aged 75 and above who will account for 54%
of the ageing population in 2050. The increasing
demand for such facilities is an area that investors

familiarity, allowing clients to call it home.

Just like living at home, there are no clinical nurses
or doctors at the facility. The care is provided by the
facility ambassadors who are specially trained and
who live with the residents, just like a family member.
The team’s philosophy is to create a culture where
activities are resident led, enabling them to feel a
sense of accomplishment.

**Sun City Ginza East**
Sun City Ginza East is Japan’s first urban, large
scale senior living continuing care retirement
communities (CCRC). In Japan, CRCC as the
government envisions them, are villas located
outside of Tokyo where the seniors live and have
easy access not only to medical and social welfare
services, but also a wide range of activities that allow
them to better integrate into the community.

Sun City, driven by the Chairman’s vision for a
development to be highly service-oriented and of
very premier quality that houses a community where
the residents are proud to live in, launched in October
2006, an innovative integrated housing model that
combines the concept of a CCRC and provision of a
full continuum of care delivery

Located in downtown Tokyo’s Ginza on a shopping
street, Sun City Ginza East is a 32-storey retirement
community that comprises of 134 rooms of nursing
specific floors and 276 independent living
condominiums on 24 floors. The retirement
community partnered with a local hospital to provide
a clinic on the second floor that is opened to the
public. The building houses a restaurant that is also
available to the public.

**Zenkoukai**
Zenkoukai is Japan’s leading and progressive


welfare association that is dedicated to nursing care,
operating within Tokyo. As the frontrunner of
introducing advanced technology in nursing care,
Zenkoukai adopts a wide range of datasets to
perform scientific methods such as big data analysis
that utilises Artificial Intelligence to manage
operations and restructuring. These operations
include personalised services for the customers,
back-office operations that indirectly support supply
of services and management operations.

The Santafe Garden Hills by Zenkoukai houses an
in-house research institute. The research institute
aims to improve existing processes and equipment
used in the facility. By leveraging on the information
collected over the years as an aged care provider,
information is translated into useful data to improve
the current processes and tools used to provide care,
thus enhancing the care quality and experience of
their customers. The Santafe Garden Hills facility
provides integrated care ranging from special
nursing, short stay to day care service for both
dementia and non-dementia.

At Zenkoukai, robots are also used for
communication and companionship with the clients
and support exercise activities, which helped in staff
productivity. Zenkoukai prides itself for the low staff
turnover and higher than industry average wages for
its staff.

**KEY CHALLENGES IN THE AGED CARE SECTOR**
An ageing society is a key challenge, as it will place a
considerable amount of stress on the National
Pension System, with a larger proportion of the
population qualifying for payment in coming years.
Social security payments alone accounted for 33.3%
of the Government expenditure in 2017. With pension
payments growing at a faster rate than contributions,

the gap between insurance costs and revenue will be

expected to increase exponentially.


economy.


26


Healthcare cost containment has been brought up as
a more prominent issue in recent years, where
healthcare spending is considered to take up a huge
share of the GDP at 10.9% in 2017, the 6th highest

24

share amongst all countries.

As Japan moves towards an old-old ageing
population and based on the studies on frailty and
dementia, the turning point for seniors’ health is
estimated to start from age 80 onwards. For frailty
amongst women, it was observed that this may
happen earlier from age 75 onwards. With the
growing old-old ageing population, the current
policies to support seniors may need to be
reassessed along with the infrastructure and
healthcare options to cater for this group who may
require higher level of care.

Due to shrinking working population, Japan’s aged
care sector has been facing a shortage of staff. The
shortage is further exacerbated with the everincreasing ageing population experienced in Japan,
where seniors aged 75 and above will be the largest
group within the ageing population. It would increase
from 18 million, i.e. 42% of the ageing population in
2020 to 21 million (48%) in 2025 and further increase
to 25 million (54%) in 2050. There were 1.9 million
care workers 2016, but if the growth projection
continues along its current trajectory, an additional
550,000 additional care workers will be required by

25

the end of 2025.

Additionally, with a dwindling workforce, economic
growth and financial markets will be impacted due to
lower levels of savings and investment levels. In fact,
a dwindling workforce results in a lower quality of
goods and services overall, indirectly impacting the


Japan has taken steps to address these key
challenges. Programmes under Prime Minister Abe’s
economic policy package, dubbed Abenomics,
include those that focus on technological innovation
to raise productivity, reduce caregiver burdens and
minimise healthcare costs. Policies that will raise
retirement ages and pension eligibility are also being
discussed. This will take significant pressure off the
healthcare system and when combined together,
these policies will expand productive workforce years
while at the same time, ease the financial burden of

27

pension obligations.

With the shortages of aged care workers and rapidly
ageing society, technological innovation will help to
enhance its nursing care, treatment development and
diagnosis support. The Ministry of Economy, Trade
and Industry has provided a total of US$45 million in
subsidies to promote the development of robotics for
nursing care. Such technologies and automation will
be highly in demand to support the aged care
industry to fill the gap in the shortages of healthcare
workers and the care required by the ageing society.

**OPPORTUNITIES IN AGEING**
Known as the country with the greatest ageing
population in the world, it was highlighted that the
number of Japanese aged over 65 is above 28% and
will be set to increase to almost 10% at more than
38% in 40 years according to a report generated by

28

the Government of Japan Cabinet Office.

This will necessitate the demand towards a
significant number of senior living facilities and
services over the next few decades. Investors should
be able to enjoy reliable returns whereas operators
can use the additional funding to improve efficiency

and strengthen cashflows.

Improvements in efficiency system and work
environment is paramount to the industry’s long-term
viability, leading to higher productivity and
investments. These successful methods can be
exported to other countries in the future, when the
effects of an ageing population set in and investors
and operators alike can reap the economic benefits.

The Japanese government has transformed the
healthcare market through deregulation and
international free trade deals, and this has opened up
opportunities for foreign business to invest in
healthcare product and services option to seniors in
Japan.

The market has been leveraging on its technology
expertise to innovate and develop robotics,
automation and universal housing designs to enable
better living environment for the seniors and where
possible, to lessen the burdens of healthcare workers
and caregivers through automation and robotics.
Based on feedback received from facilities, robotics
have improved the productivity of their staff and
improved quality of life of the residents, resulting in
higher contact hours between residents and
healthcare staff.

An ageing population will pose as a considerable
challenge for Japan, although not unmanageable.
Being at the forefront of an ageing society, Japan will
be presented with a unique leadership opportunity to
implement and create effective responses to the
challenges ahead.

While Japan is currently the fastest aging AsiaPacific nation, other nations are also expected to age
at a rapid pace over the next few decades. Countries
will be turning to Japan for innovations, policy

adjustment and the ensuing results. There is an

opportunity to create a sustainable eco-system within
the aged care industry for the future. With their silver
market experience and technologies, there is
opportunity for the key market players to export their
products and services to other countries, to support
the ageing society globally.

## 6.Country Overview: MalaysiaCountry Overview: Australia

Malaysia has a population of about 32 million, with
more than 3.5 million citizens aged 60 and above as
of year 2020. It is forecasted that by 2040, the
number of seniors in Malaysia aged 60 and above

5

will nearly double, reaching 6.9 million.


Like many other developed countries, Malaysia is
facing a demographic transition mainly caused by
falling fertility rates and increasing longevity. Life

6

mortality at birth is currently 76.22 years and healthy

7

life expectancy at 66.62 years. With a gap of almost

ten years, some form of care is needed – either in the
form of health management, assisted living or
nursing care.

Seniors in Malaysia are defined as those aged 60
and above. In a random sampling study conducted by
Badrasawi, Shahar & Ajit Singh (2017), it was found
that the prevalence of frailty in seniors is 8.9%, which
is around 1 in every 10 seniors. Additionally, the

8

prevalence of pre-frailty was found to be at 61.7%.

This poses a serious concern as it may lead to an
increase in the risk of critical health outcomes in
seniors such as falls, hospitalisation, disability, poor
health-related quality of life, nutrition, age-related
diseases and mortality. This infers that as the
Malaysian society ages, the number of seniors
requiring higher care and healthcare products will be
expected to increase.

Malaysia has national healthcare system that is
recognised to deliver quality healthcare at affordable
prices. As such, Malaysia is spending only 4.5% of its
gross domestic product (GDP) on healthcare. The


The current trend will allow private healthcare sector
to play a larger role, allowing investors to benefit from

government allocated an additional US$477 Million
(RM2 billion) for healthcare, with a total sum of

Similar to other ageing population, the productivity of
the economy would be impacted by the retirement of
seniors, if the younger generations are not able to fill
the gap left by these seniors. Current retirement age
may need to be reviewed and seniors encouraged to
stay in the workforce longer to continue contributing
to economy, whilst keeping these seniors occupied
and active.

The current healthcare system may be overburdened
with the increasing number of seniors aged 60 years
and above. This population group will face agerelated health issues such as frailty, dementia,
disability, physical falls and chronic diseases. Health
management programmes and preventive health
management initiatives can be considered to support
seniors to age better in health and delay the onset of
frailty.

The number of private healthcare options have
increased over the last twenty years, providing a
wider range of options including level of service and
price differences for clients to consider. Affordability
for private healthcare remains an issue for the ageing
population, predominantly for those without health
insurance.

Financial capacity will be an issue for those of a
lower socio-economic status as a longer life
expectancy and rising costs of living will raise the
question of affordability to meet their basic daily living
expenditure and their quality of live. Further
intervention from government would be required to
address these gaps in daily living costs, healthcare
funding and social security.

In 2010, the Healthcare National Key Economic Area
(NKEA) identified aged care as one of the longerterm business opportunities. As such, several
initiatives were identified to support the silver

industry, such as the development of regulations and
physical planning guidelines for aged care facilities.
Caregiver training, aged care home renovations and
development of financial services catered towards
seniors have been developed to help support the

12

silver industry.

According to National Health and Morbidity Survey
2018 by Malaysia’s Ministry of Health, the overall
prevalence of dementia is 8.5% amongst those aged
above 60. However, those living in rural areas
showed a higher prevalence level of 12.9% as
compared to those living in urban areas at 6.8%.
Seniors with higher socioeconomic status and
education has been predicted to have a lower
prevalence of dementia as compared to those from
the lower end.

It is paramount for policy makers, clinicians and
programme managers to take note that those of a
poorer social standing will have higher prevalence of

13

dementia.

**GOVERNMENT POLICIES & INITIATIVES**

**National Policy for Elderly (NPE)**

16

In 1995, the National Policy for Elderly was

approved in conjunction with the National Day of
Older Persons. The national policy, tasked to the
Department of Social Welfare, was established to
ensure the social status, dignity and well-being of
seniors as members of the family, society and nation
by enabling them to optimise their self-potential, have
access to all opportunities and have provision for
their care protection.

The policy’s Plan of Action was introduced by
Technical Committee and consisted of six subcommittees – Social and recreation, Health,
Education, religion and training, Housing, Research
and Information.

This led to the establishment of the National Advisory
and Consultative Council on Elderly (NACCE) under
the chairmanship of the Minister of Women, Family
and Community Development in May 1996.


health promotion, provision of a continuum of
comprehensive healthcare services, human resource
planning and development, information systems,
research and development, interagency and intersector collaboration and legislation.

**National Policy for Older Persons (NPOP),**
The National Policy for Older Persons was approved
by Cabinet under the Minster of Women, Family and
Community Development in January 2011. This
policy works together with National Health Policy for
Older Persons.

The policy focuses on empowering individuals,
families and communities by establishing seniorfriendly services and enabling environments to
improve the quality of life of the seniors.

Its goals are to

   - improve the respect and self-worth of the
seniors within their family, society and nation

   - encourage seniors to remain active and
productive in national development and create
opportunities for independent living

   - promote more specialised facilities to care and
protect the seniors.

The policy aimed to achieve this through promotion
and advocacy, lifelong learning, security and
protection, management and shared responsibilities,
participation and unity across generations, and
research and development.


**National Health Policy for Older Persons**

17

The National Health Policy for Older Persons was

introduced as part of a review on the NPE under the
Ministry of Health (MOH) in 2008.

Its objectives were to improve the health status of
seniors, encourage participation in health promotion
and disease prevention activities, advocate and
support development of enabling environment for
independent living (ageing-in-place) and provide age
friendly, affordable equitable accessible, culturally
acceptable, gender sensitive, seamless healthcare
services in a holistic manner at all levels.

Strategies planned to achieve its objectives include

regulated. This helps to ensure that a minimum
acceptable level of standard of care is adhered to by
these facilities.

Key features of the Act include:

   - The Act requires residential and day care
facilities and any operator looking to provide
private aged care to four or more aged person
to apply for an operating licence.

   - Application for approval to provide aged
healthcare facilities and services. The
interested operators are required to first apply
for approval to provide such services. The
criteria for approval will be based on the type
of premises where facilities and services will
be provided; the type of healthcare services to
be provided; the availability of and access to
existing private facilities and services in the
area of application for approval; and the
present and future needs for such services in
the area of application.

   - Upon approval, the operators have a
maximum of three years from the approval
date to apply for the operating licence. Failing
which, the approval as an operator will be
revoked. The licence to operate is renewable
every three years with MOH’s approval.

   - An inspection of the premises will be
conducted to determine if the premises
comply with the standards imposed.

   - Upon receiving the license, aged care
providers are required to adhere to the
required standards. In the event of any lapses
to comply or complaints received, the licence
will be revoked if the accusations are deemed
true.


The strict implementation of such an act will serve as
a quality structure for aged care in Malaysia. This will
set the standard for better care and facilities in the
long run, removing any stigma of mistreatment in

19

such facilities.

**Eleventh Malaysia Plan, 2016-2020**
The enhancement of quality of life of the seniors was
undertaken as part of Eleventh Malaysia Plan in view
of the increasing ageing population and the number
of senior citizens continue contributing to society
even in their golden years. The enhancements
include improvements of supportive environments for
seniors, promoting active ageing, and near-universal
public healthcare for seniors under MOH.

The improvement of supportive environment for
seniors was accomplished through various initiatives
to provide senior-friendly infrastructure and improve
care services catered towards seniors. This included
the establishments of more day care centres in
collaboration with non-governmental organisations
(NGOs) as well as expanding senior care centres
and Home Help services. Awareness programmes on
senior care were also strengthened to shift the senior
community to adopt active and healthy lifestyles.

Social protection for the under-privileged seniors has
been streamlined and integrated to ensure better
quality of life with provision of assistance based on
basic needs. The low-income group in the informal
sector were also encouraged to participate in
voluntary savings and retirement schemes to ensure
economic protection in their old age.

Another enhancement was the promotion of active
ageing, where the Institute of Gerontology, Universiti
Putra Malaysia was tasked to conduct more research
to support active ageing. The University of the Third

Age (U3A) Programme was also expanded to provide
opportunities for seniors to continuously learn and
acquire knowledge and skills in collaboration with
universities, community colleges and Pusat Aktiviti
Warga Emas with NGOs. These learning institutes
were encouraged to implement self-help based
learning programmes.

A national campaign to promote social awareness on
volunteerism among retired professionals was also
launched to encourage seniors to participate in
community-based activities. This would allow them to
remain active by contributing their knowledge, skills
and experience to benefit the community.

**DEVELOPMENT OF ELDERCARE SERVICES &**
**SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES**

The ageing population set to reach 14.3% in 2030
and more than half of these seniors are at pre-frail
stage, the demand for aged care services and
accommodation options for seniors is set to increase
notably. As the economy transitions to high-income
economy by 2024, the developing silver market in
Malaysia offers an array of opportunities for
businesses to support the nation’s ageing population.

According to Eleventh Malaysia Plan, there are only
four retirement villages in Malaysia as of 2017. With
a lack of retirement villages, these pre-frail seniors
face a dilemma between staying in their own homes
or moving to a nursing home. Nursing homes are
generally catered towards those who are extremely
frail, and family homes have become too costly,
difficult to maintain and not particularly seniorfriendly.

In a survey done by Universiti Malaya academics, it
was found out that many Malaysian seniors find


bathrooms in their existing homes unsafe. Many of
these pre-frail seniors who still enjoy an independent
and active lifestyle would opt to live in a retirement

20

village.

Some older Malaysians may prefer to remain in their
own homes for as long as possible. The in-home
care services will help Malaysians to extend their
independence and support ageing-in-place. Assistive
technologies will play an important part in helping to
address the needs of the ageing population as well.

The demand for aged care workers, nurses, allied
health and other health professionals will be
expected to increase as the population ages. This will
serve as a lucrative career opportunity for those in
the working population, to find productive and
meaningful work.

**OVERVIEW OF FACILITIES IN MALAYSIA**

Long-term care in Malaysia is currently offered by the
government-funded welfare homes (public sector),
private nursing home and care centres (for-profit) and
voluntary aged care organisations and centres (notfor-profit).

Before the Private Aged Healthcare Facilities and
Services Act (2018), there were many unlicensed
nursing home and care centres, implying a large
demand but insufficient supply. The Act will enable
the government to track and monitor these nursing
homes, residential care homes and day care centres
to ensure a minimum standard of quality of care is
provided to the clients.

There are a few prominent facilities that are licensed
in Malaysia and have been recognised as one of the
leading providers of aged care services and senior

nearby, with a dedicated dementia home.

**KEY CHALLENGES IN MALAYSIA AGED CARE**
**SECTOR**

One of the key challenges in the aged care sector in
Malaysia would be the lack of suitable regulatory and
policy framework for retirement villages. Without
proper guidelines, it is challenging for an operator or
developer to venture into the aged care market. The
development of a retirement village that offers a
“continuum-of-care” faces regulatory obstacles
across two separate Acts under two separate
ministries.

The Malaysian government has been actively
working towards addressing the current issues within
the regulatory framework. With a supportive
regulatory framework in place, retirement villages can
be a lucrative sector for investors and operators
alike, as such facilities would enable seniors to stay
connected to the social and work opportunities within
the community.

Malaysia’s retirement financial protection poses as a
significant challenge for the aged care sector.

## 6.Country Overview: MalaysiaCountry Overview: Australia

Despite being established more than 5 decades ago,
the accumulated resources for seniors at retirement
are modest and appears insufficient for a life annuity.
Private sector retirees do not receive a government
pension and will rely on the funds available from the
mandatory retirement savings - Employee Provident

22

Fund (EPF). The level of health and welfare

investment needed would be crucial in the coming
years. A re-structuring of EPF scheme from being an
investment fund for retirement savings into a
comprehensive pension fund would be crucial.


The primary care of seniors may pose some
challenges as health-seeking behaviour of Malaysia
seniors tend to seek multiple medical opinions,
resulting in a breakdown of communication between

23

general practitioners and specialists.

With an ageing population, demand for healthcare
professionals, skilled nurses, doctors and allied
health is be expected to increase. There is, however,
a dire shortage of professional staff. In late 2019,
there are only 20 geriatricians in practice compared

24

to a required amount of 400. This gap need to be

filled to ensure adequate healthcare support is
provided to the ageing population, and this can be
fulfilled through encouraging the younger generation
to opt for aged care career path or allow more foreign
companies to bring in their knowledge and expertise
in aged care to train existing healthcare workers or to
setup an operations of aged care services in
Malaysia.

**OPPORTUNITIES IN AGEING**


group will turn the silver economy into a significant
stand-alone sector that employs a wide range of
products, services and care arrangements.

Increasing demands for healthcare professionals and
aged care experts will ensure that the aged care
sector is attractive in the labour market, and
opportunities for foreign market leaders to bring in
their expertise in age care and to train healthcare
workforce.

With strategic and targeted policies such as the
Private Aged Healthcare Facilities and Services
Regulations Act, the enticement of the silver market
in Malaysia will bring in investors and entrepreneurs
alike. This will have a butterfly effect on other
businesses in the aged care sector and a sustainable
ecosystem will be developed.

## 6.Country Overview: MyanmarCountry Overview: Australia

**OVERVIEW**

Ever since the first democratic elections in Myanmar
in 2015, the country has experienced rapid economic
growth of more than 7% annually until 2019. A
combination of factors such as the modernisation of
economic and financial institutions and systems,
unification of exchange rates and several other
factors have contributed to the success of the GDP
growth. Social welfare has improved measurably
since and poverty rates almost halved, from 48% in

1

2005 to 25% in 2017.

Before the global pandemic, economic growth in


Myanmar was forecasted at 6.4% in 2020 and 6.7%
in 2021. Based on Asian Development Bank’s latest
economic update, it is forecasted that Myanmar will
experience a lower GDP growth at 1.8% to US$77
billion in 2020 but is expected to recover in 2021, with

2

a forecasted GDP growth of 6% to US$81 billion.

The economy will be expected to bounce back in
2021, in line with the rest of Asia Pacific. GDP Per
Capita in 2018 was reported at US$1,326 and
forecasted to increase to US$1,419 in 2020 and
US$1,787 in 2025.

Myanmar has a population of over 54 million, with

around 5.4 million or 10% of the population aged 60
and over as of 2020. By 2050, the number of those
aged above 60 will more than double to 11.5 million,

3

or 18.5% of the total population.


Population ageing in Myanmar is driven by two
prominent points – a declining fertility rate and as
well as increasing longevity. Myanmar’s fertility rate
has dropped to just a little above replacement level to
2.25 in 2015, from 2.85 in 2005. As Myanmar
continues to develop, both trends are expected to

4

continue.

In 2015, life expectancy at birth is at 65.64 years and

5

has increased to 67.17 years in just 5 years. As

observed in the ageing population chart, Myanmar
has a young-old ageing population due to their life
expectancy at 67 years, which is the lowest in the
region.

6

With healthy life expectancy at 58.41 years, there

exists a gap of about nine years where some form of
healthcare is needed – either in the form of health
management programme, assisted living services or
nursing care. The relatively younger ageing
population would require different approach to
support them to age well or the care required.


As a rapidly developing country, Myanmar’s
healthcare landscape has improved tremendously in
previous years. Myanmar’s health expenditure in
2011 is only 1.7% of their GDP. In 2017, the
percentage sharply increased to 4.6% of their GDP.
Myanmar’s out-of-pocket expenditure for healthcare
moved from to 80.7% of their health expenditure in

7

2010 to 76.2% of their health expenditure in 2017.

Despite these improvements, Myanmar is still far
behind its neighbouring countries in East Asia-pacific

8

region at 6.5%.


**INDUSTRY OUTLOOK**

In Myanmar, family members are seen as the
primary source of caregiving support for seniors.
However, as family structures evolve and the needs
of seniors become increasingly complex,
interventions will have to adapt to be effective. It was
found that amongst seniors in Myanmar, 11.5% were
fully dependent, 40% were highly dependent, 46%
were semi-dependent and only 2.5% are active and

9

fully independent.

Traditionally in Myanmar, nursing homes are viewed
to be for vulnerable seniors who are either
impoverished or have no one to look after them. It will
take time for a shift in the mindset of the Myanmar
community to accept sending their loved ones into a
nursing home or a geriatric hospital. The trend of
sending seniors to such facilities will pick up due to
the rapidly ageing population.

To facilitate the transition to a new aged care model,
the country needs to address major structural
bottlenecks including, limited access to essential
medical and social care services as well as weak
collaboration across relevant sectors. However,
Myanmar’s population is ageing at a rate slower than
its neighbouring counterparts. As such, the gradual
changes will give the country more time to adjust and
adapt before the silver wave.

In a 2014 report published by the Ministry of Labour,
Immigration and Population and UNFPA, 22% of
seniors aged 65 and above still work in agriculture, a
physically demanding sector. The need for adequate
social services, protection mechanisms and policies
will need to be addressed to serve the senior
population. Retirement schemes, employment
opportunities across different sectors, upskilling of
senior workers will help the ageing population in
addressing financial concerns in old age.

**GOVERNMENT POLICIES & INITIATIVES**

In 2016, the Myanmar Elderly Committee was
implemented to address the needs of the ageing
population. The aim of the committee is to bring
about social development and personal rights for
seniors. In the ministry’s framework, senior
identification cards will be handed out to all seniors.
These cards will serve to subsidise healthcare, travel
and other financial costs. The committee will
collaborate across sectors in taking care of

10

Myanmar’s seniors.


**National Social Protection Strategic Plan**


**11**


The government of Myanmar aims to create a noncontributory social pension programme to support the
income security of seniors aged 65 and above with
US$18.50 a month. The Ministry of Social Welfare,
Relief and Resettlement will make pension payments
to seniors aged 85 and above, revised from 90 years
old in 2017 monthly. The pension payment is valued
at US$7.50 a month and has been allocated a
government budget of US$300,000.


**Myanmar’s Action Plan on Ageing**


**12**


In 2014, Myanmar’s action plan on ageing was
introduced to prepare for the demographic transition
and to ensure the well-being of seniors. The national
policy for seniors was one of the key areas of the
action plan and will encourage employers to hire
seniors through incentives. The focus is on income
security, participation and access to resources for
seniors.

The action plan aims to strengthen collaborations
across organisations supporting seniors through
senior citizen networks between NGOs and
government networks. programmes include
fundraising for small businesses, agricultural
technology and training activities. The Older People’s


Self Help Groups (OPSHGs) was also formed and
approved by the government. As of 2014, there are
63 OHSHGs catering to 20,000 seniors.

**DEVELOPMENT OF ELDERCARE SERVICES &**
**SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES**

With an ageing population, there is an increasing
need for infrastructure and resources for seniors.
This will generate a demand for more senior care
facilities, day care centres, geriatric hospitals and
specialised caregivers in senior care.

The long-term care system in Myanmar is largely
fragmented, with informal care provided by family
and friends being heavily relied upon. Additionally,
senior care services are distributed disproportionately
across the country, with most of it being found in
urban areas. Such services are reliant on project
funding, donations and volunteers. As such, they are
not suitable for upscaling as they are not costeffective. These services are managed by NGOs and
charitable organisations, with support from the
government. 41,219 seniors are being offered home
care by private and charitable organisations through

13

OPSHGs in 2015.

In the Action Plan for Ageing, several models of care
are currently being implemented and expanded.
These include home care, community-based support,
day care centres and residential care facilities.

Myanmar aims to achieve universal health coverage
and has been expanding health services. Private
drug stores, clinics and hospitals are the main source
of healthcare for seniors. According to the policies
implemented by the Ministry of Health, seniors will be
able to access government hospitals for
consultations free-of-charge. However, medication

## 6.Country Overview: MyanmarCountry Overview: Australia

and treatment will have to come from out-of-pocket
expenses as Myanmar does not have medical
insurance coverage. Most of these expenses are
funded by voluntary contributors, NGOs and
charitable organisations.

**OVERVIEW OF FACILITIES IN MYANMAR**

In 2015, there are 78 registered nursing homes in
Myanmar providing care to 3,402 seniors. There is a
severe lack of facilities for seniors, as these nursing
homes have long waiting lines.

There are government and private charitable day
care centres offering meals and basic healthcare to
seniors and others who are destitute, with the
condition that the beneficiaries have no family
members.

**Ageing Asia Curated Facilities**

**Community Based Care Service**
Myanmar initiated ROK-ASEAN Home Care for Older
People Project in 2004. The main aim of the project
is to take care of health and social welfare of seniors
who are poor and lonely due to various reasons to
allow for a better living. The essence of the activity is
to take care of the lonesome by well-trained
volunteers through home care system.

Caring model is social caring service and primary
health care service such as first aid.
The National YMCA in collaboration with Department
of Social Welfare (DSW) carried out the ROKASEAN Home Care for Older People Project Phase I
(2003-2006) in 2004 in two townships of Yangon
Region.

Subsequently, the project phase II (2006-2009) was


also successfully implemented in 17 target townships
of 7 states and regions. The project phase II was
carried out by NGOs such as Myanmar Women’s
Affairs Federation (MWAF), Myanmar Maternal and
Child.

**Hnin Si Gone Home for the Aged**
Hnin Si Gone Home for Aged is located in Yangon. It
was originally established on 1 January 1933 by Daw
Oo Zun but was closed when World War II broke out.
It was reopened on 4 April 1943 by U Tin, the
General Manager of Myanmar Alin daily newspapers
along with the help of some Venerable Senior Monks
and donors. Towards the end of the World War II, the
home was relocated to a seven-acres of undeveloped
land a short distance from central Yangon at Bahan
Township in 1952.

The new home was completed in April of 1955 and
was formally inaugurated by the Honourable Prime
Minister U Nu on 20th March 1957. Since then, they
have accommodated 240 seniors, the highest
number in the country. The nursing home provides
regular festivals and activities for its seniors and is
mostly financially supported through public
donations.

**Mingun Buddhist Home For The Aged**
The Buddhist Home for Aged People was founded in
1915 and is located in Mingun, a beautiful, peaceful
ancient city located along the Ayerwaddy river, one
hour by boat from Mandalay. The home is financially
supported entirely from donations given by devout
Buddhists and foreign tourists. This private nursing
home currently house around 78 Burmese seniors
who have no family to care for them.

**Mother’s Union Myanmar (MU)**
The home accepts women of all faiths. They
currently have eight Christian residents and eight

## 6.Country Overview: MyanmarCountry Overview: Australia

Buddhist residents. This is an indication of the way
how MU in Myanmar operates – while very much
being an organisation of the Church, they are aware
that they operate in a context where the majority
religion is Buddhism and the MU recognise that the
needs of families are similar regardless of faith and
ideology.

The residents sleep in two shared dormitories
(segregated based on ability/mobility) and supported
by three full time carers who cook and provide round
the clock care. The carers are qualified nurses, while
there would be a monthly visit by a local Doctor to
provide medical care to the residents.

The home does not receive any external funding to
support the operating costs (which is around US$800
dollars per month when the home operates at full
capacity). It is supported entirely by all 8,000+
members throughout the Province.

**Myanmar Medical Association and Private – Day**
**Care Centres**
There are currently two day care centres established
in Yangon by the Myanmar Medical Association and
Private. Opened in November 2013, the objective of
the day care centres is to reduce social isolation and
promote active ageing. Care programmes cover a
variety of areas, which is inclusive but not limited to –
social care, health care, life-long learning activities,
recreation, well-being and nutrition in later life.

**Phyu Home for the Aged**
The Catholic Home for the Aged, which is located on
Thein Phyu Road in Mingalar Taung Nyunt
Township, has 135 seniors aged between 66 and 99.
Five older men and one older woman aged between
74 and 85 have some form of dementia. The nurses
are Catholic sisters.


**Sakura Community Service & Egao Ichiban**
A consortium consisting of nursing care providers
from Japan – Sakura Community Service and Egao
Ichiban has expanded to Myanmar to test out home
health care operations. Sakura and its partners look
to bring caregivers trained in Myanmar to Japanese
facilities through Japan's foreign technical trainee
programme. Caregivers who are eligible for
participation and other qualifications will work in
Japan for up to five years. After which, the
companies will relocate participants in relevant jobs
back in Myanmar.

**Save the Aged**
Save the Aged is a voluntary non-government
welfare organisation, with a purpose to serve needy
seniors that require care but have nowhere to turn to.
It was established in 2010 jointly by 15 people to help
seniors in need.

There are three main criteria for seniors to be
accepted into the home.

   - The senior must be over 65.

   - The senior must not have highly contagious
diseases, as it could infect the rest of the
residents.

   - The senior must have no living children for
source of support. This last criterion, however,
is flexible depending on the circumstances.

The home is funded through the local community, as
well as Myanmar nationals living overseas. The
home funds for their living monthly expenses,
including medical care. There are currently eight fulltime employees and 25 residents. The nursing home
currently provides home care to 12 seniors as well.

**Shwe Than Lwin Home for the Aged**
The Shwe Than Lwin Home for the Aged, located in
Ward 80 of Dagon Seikkan Township, is a level-two
ranked facility. It cares for a total of 63 seniors.
Amongst all the residents, seven are living with
advanced signs of dementia. These residents are
cared for by 20 staff who are trained in caring for
seniors, a course provided by the Department of
Social Welfare.

**KEY CHALLENGES IN MYANMAR AGED CARE**
**SECTOR**

In Myanmar, strong cultural and religious traditions of
respecting and caring for seniors implies that social
and financial support will be the main responsibility of
the family. These family members may lack the
knowledge of health care and proper caregiving
techniques and as such, may face caregiving stress
that could negatively impact the care recipient.
Caregiver training programmes and home care
programmes can help to alleviate the issue.

Access and affordability are main issues for seniors
using health services. This is especially likely in
lower income households and seniors living in rural
areas. Healthcare cost and affordability is a concern
for this group of vulnerable seniors. A third of the
ageing population are living in rural areas where
there is no access to electricity and 58% lack running

14

water.

Another challenge is the insufficient number of
healthcare workforce in Myanmar. As of 2016, there
are 16,292 medical doctors and 36,054 nurses
working in 1,134 hospitals under the management of
the Ministry of Health. Out of 15 states and regions,
13 were below the World Health Organisation’s
recommended minimum number of 1 medical doctor


per 1,000 population. Urban and rural areas also
showed disparities in the distribution of doctors, with
rural areas facing a severe shortage of professionals.
The growing demand will serve as career
opportunities for the working population. The
Government of Myanmar will have to consider costeffective supply-chain management systems,
education and retention strategies to alleviate the

15

shortage.

The Government’s focus on economic development,
poverty elimination and increased agricultural
productivity will ultimately enhance the wellbeing of
seniors and their families.

To help seniors live healthier and longer, increasing
affordable access to healthcare through restructuring the healthcare infrastructure to one that is
sustainable and feasible in the long run will be
required. Investing in development for a long-term
care system will be essential to meet the needs of
the growing population. The working population in the
formal sector should be incentivised to save for their
retirement in the future.

By improving senior healthcare and encouraging
savings for retirement from a young age, the future
seniors will be able to live more independently and
afford healthcare. This will relieve the societal burden
of an ageing population and seniors can continue to
stay active, healthy and connected to the society.

**OPPORTUNITIES IN AGEING**

The increasing life expectancy within the population
is a result of better-informed health choices and
improving health services. Although economy growth
has not been rapid, it has been stable throughout the
years and the upward trend can be expected to

153

i i

continue.

With a lack of senior care facilities and aged care
workforce, these gaps need to be addressed to
support the increasing demand for aged care product
and services from the ageing population that would
soon reach 7.67 million seniors aged 60 and above,
or 13.1% of the total population by 2030.

While the Government is taking more initiatives to
establish a sustainable ecosystem for the aged care
market, the social stigma of aged care facilities and
affordability amongst seniors for healthcare and aged
care services remain to a challenge for the emerging
silver economy.

With other Asia Pacific countries transiting to superaged nations, supported by its government initiatives
and advancement in the aged care products and
services, Myanmar can look towards these countries
to select the best practices, strategies and products
towards catering for the needs of their own ageing
population. Myanmar as an emerging market overall,
holds substantial growth opportunities.

**OVERVIEW**

Due to the global pandemic crisis, New Zealand’s
GDP in 2020 is expected to experience recession
with negative growth of 7.2% to US$194 billion as
forecasted by IMF. It is projected to have a steady

1

recovery of 5.9% growth to US$205 billion in 2021.

New Zealand’s steady GDP growth in previous years
reflects the country’s economic freedom.

Ranked 3rd amongst 42 other Asia Pacific countries
on economic freedom in 2020, New


Zealand’s GDP annual growth has averaged 2.1%
since March 2010. Despite a corporate tax rate of
28%, foreign investors do not shy away as New
Zealand’s economy is seen to be reliable, resilient

2

and highly safe to do business. New Zealand’s GDP

Per Capita was US$41,945 in 2018 and is forecasted
to increase to US$44,000 in 2025 despite the global
crisis.

New Zealand has a population of over 4.9 million,
with 1.1 million or 22.2% of the population aged 60

and above will nearly double over the next 40 years.
By 2036, New Zealand will definitely be a super-aged
nation with more than 20% aged 65 and above, such
that for every 4.5 New Zealanders, 1 will be aged 65

4

and above.


5

The life mortality at birth is currently 82.4 years and

6

healthy life expectancy is 72.8 years. Based on the

difference of close to 10 years, we can extrapolate
that some form of assistance would be required –
either in the form of assisted living services or
nursing care.

The healthcare expenditure of New Zealand is
approximately US$13 billion in 2019 - 2020 which
accounts for about 20% of government spending and
around 6.6% of the country’s GDP. There has been a
US$1.9 billion increase in health spending since 2017

- 2018, or around a 15% increase.


**INDUSTRY OUTLOOK**

The growing proportion of people aged over 60 within
New Zealand population has a profound implication
on the silver industry. Firstly, New Zealand seniors
are a growing consumer group. In 2016, the total
amount of spending by those aged 65 and above
amounted to a total of US$13 billion and is forecasted
to more than triple in 2061, at US$61 billion.

As part of the Positive Ageing Strategy, seniors are
also growing as a workforce. In 2016, 6.5% of the
total population in paid employment is taken up by
seniors. In 2061, the percentage is expected to
nearly double to 12.4%, or approximately 397,200.


The growing trend of New Zealand seniors taking up
voluntary work will be expected to grow. In a TimeUse Survey conducted, it showed that seniors
contributed close to 30 hours of unpaid work a week.
Using the ‘Carer Wage’ identified in the report
“Economic Value and Impacts of Informal Care in
New Zealand”, the cost of unpaid work is valued at

9

US$10.5 an hour.

_Data source: The Business of Ageing Update (2015)._

i i


New Zealand has experienced a significant
expansion of its medical workforce since 2000. As of
2015, the country has 84 doctors per 100,000
population and there were over 1,087 nurses per

7

100,000 people. This is possibly and partly due to

the high rate of employment of seniors (74.4%), high
pension coverage (98%) of people over 65, and
seniors living a longer and healthier life.

Over the last half a century, the senior group has
consistently outpaced the growth of total New
Zealand population. By 2030, 26% of the population
or over 1.3 million will be aged over 60 and by 2050,
29% of the population or over 1.6 million will be aged
over 60. Small towns and rural localities will observe
a faster shift in their age composition, including a

8

decrease in the number of young people.

## 6.Country Overview: New ZealandCountry Overview: Australia

Through these figures, it is projected that the value of
seniors’ unpaid and voluntary contribution will rise up
to four times more in 2051 as compared to 2011.

Dementia is another growing issue that has to be
addressed. In the Dementia Economic Impact report
2016, there are over 48,000 seniors living with
dementia in 2011 to over 62,000 people living with
dementia in 2016 and forecasted to increase to over


170,000 in 2050.

The costs associated with dementia has increased by
more than 75% from US$659 million in 2011 to more
than US$1 billion in 2016. In fact, the number is

10

expected to grow to US$2.7 billion by 2030.

Prevalence of dementia in 2016 is 1.3% and the
number is projected to increase to 2.9% of the
population in 2050.


_Data source: Deloitte Access Economics calculations based on Alzheimer’s Disease International (2015), Deloitte Access Economics_
_(2012) and Statistics New Zealand (2015c)._


As seen from the graph above, the prevalence of
dementia is higher in females (56.6%), as compared
to males (44.4%). Prevalence with dementia
increases steadily with age, particularly over the age
of 60. With the increasing number of people living
with dementia, demand for dementia care facilities,
products and technological innovations will increase
significantly to provide adequate support to maintain
quality of life for this group of seniors.


**GOVERNMENT POLICIES & INITIATIVES**

The retirement village sector is regulated via the
Retirement Villages Act 2003 and the Codes of
Practice and Residents’ Rights. Aspects of the Code
of Practice are monitored annually and where the
need arises, changes are made after extensive
consultation with all stakeholders. Generally, this is a
relatively painless process and results in improved

157

outcomes for residents and operators. It can be
expected that the Government intends a general
review of the principal Act which is unlikely to start
before 2021.

The principal regulatory changes impacting on the
age care sector has been the equal pay legislation
that resulted in significant pay increases for
caregivers (supported by increases in the
Government subsidy paid to care homes) but raised
serious problems in relativity with other employee
classes such as nurses, for whom the subsidy wasn’t
increased.

The other change has been in immigration
procedures. In the future, accredited employers will
be able to source and provide working visas for staff
who are on the skills shortage lists maintained by
Government. This is expected to improve migration
times and ease serious staff shortages.

**Retirement Savings**
The government-funded New Zealand
Superannuation (NZ Super) plan pay out savings
when citizens reach 65 years old. Although NZ Super
provides enough for basic amenities and savings, the
government has an optional voluntary work-based
retirement savings plan, “Kiwisaver”, for its workers,
implemented since 2 July 2007. Employers have to
pay 3% of the gross wage monthly and workers will
have their salary invested in this scheme every
month. At 65, the money can be withdrawn and in the
event of emergencies, the money can be accessed

11

earlier.

**DEVELOPMENT OF ELDERCARE SERVICES &**
**SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES**

The demand for aged care services and


As at December 2018 the retirement village
development pipeline indicated a total of 17,700 units
at some point in the design, consent or construction
phase.

The industry’s market share at December 2018 was
around 13% of those aged 75 aged and above, an
increase on the 9.4% market share recorded at the
end of 2012. 66% of retirement villages include a rest
home and/or hospital providing a degree of
residential care; and at the end of 2018, there were
approximately 20,120 care beds (51% of the total
number of care beds) that could be found in a
retirement village. Other villages concentrate only on
independent living with the minimum of care services.
This latter group tend to see themselves as “lifestyle”
villages catering for the active senior.

In general, retirement village living is about
maintaining independence. People move into a
retirement village for many reasons, and the few key
reasons are:

   - Appreciating the peace of mind that a safe,
secure and age-appropriate home brings;

accommodation options for seniors is forecasted to
increase along with the ageing population growth
rate, and the spending capacity of baby boomers.
Over the last 30 years, the popularity of retirement
(or lifestyle) village living has grown dramatically.

In 1998, there were approximately 10,000 villas and
apartments and by 2000 this had grown to 12,800

12

dwelling units (up 27%). By the end of 2018, there

were 420 registered retirement villages providing
approximately 31,550 completed villas and
apartments and which were home to around 41,000

older New Zealanders.

   - Realising the equity in their home;

   - Enjoying a wider range of social contacts and
friends;

   - Finding out about and experiencing new
leisure activities in the company of likeminded people;

   - Peace of mind around no longer having to
maintain a house and garden.

In December 2006, the Retirement Commissioner
conducted a survey of village residents. The survey
asked residents to identify the best things about
village life; and the findings showed that 55%
identified “security”, 50% rated companionship and
community spirit, and 28% identified the village’s
location and proximity to shops and services. Good
village amenities also rated well, as did the quality of
the dwellings, the condition of the grounds and “lack
of worry”.

More importantly, the same survey found that overall
satisfaction amongst residents is extremely high –
99% reported that they were satisfied or very
satisfied with their village. The reasons for
dissatisfaction include matters such as the village
rules (e.g., “Can’t put up clothes lines”), the cost, and
“it’s not what I imagined it would be like”.

**KEY CHALLENGES IN NEW ZEALAND AGED**
**CARE SECTOR**

Funding healthcare sustainability is a key challenge
faced by the government in New Zealand. New
Zealand’s total health and disability spending is about
US$11 million, or 9.5% of the GDP. Healthcare
makes up 22% of the government spending and
taxpayers fund most of the health expenditure. New
Zealand will need new sustainable ways to fund the
healthcare to ensure health welfare can continue to
be provided to its citizen, particularly with an
increasing number of the ageing population who will
need higher care as they age. With the current
model, healthcare funding is projected to increase to
11% of the GDP in 2060.

Another challenge is the New Zealand workforce
where they are ageing - 40% of doctors and 45% of
nurses are currently aged over 50 years. Additionally,
New Zealand have a largely unregulated workforce,
including their healthcare workers who have limited
access to training. As such, it is imperative that the
government continues to invest in training so that the

16

future needs of the ageing population can be met.

The needs and expectations of the population has
been changing over the recent years, partly due to
the ageing population and partly also due to the
ethnic diversity of their residents. In Auckland, there
are approximately 39% of their residents were born


overseas; Asian populations are increasing and
represent almost one to four people living in
Auckland.

These challenges, while significant, are not
insurmountable. There is much reason to be
optimistic with regards to the future of New Zealand’s
aged care sector and it’s capability to meet the needs
and preferences of the senior population well into the
future.

**OPPORTUNITIES IN AGEING**

Projected to become a super-aged nation by 2030,
New Zealand’s ageing population market boom is
expected to happen within the next ten years. The
senior population is growing rapidly and the total
amount of spending by those aged 65 and above
amounted to a total of US$13 billion in 2016 and is
forecasted to more than triple in 2061, at US$61
billion. The sector is expected to evolve into a
significant stand-alone sector that demands a wide
range of products, services and care arrangements.

The demand of aged care services and
accommodation options is expected to increase with
the ageing population growth rate and the spending
power of the baby boomers. The retirement village
living has gain popularity over the last ten years and
will continue to be in higher demand with the good
reviews provided on the existing villages. This would
entice more seniors to opt for retirement village living
options, providing an opportunity for more developers
to build such accommodation options.

With the youngest baby boomers turning 60 and
joining the ageing population in 2024, this group
presents an interesting market segment market that
is more knowledgeable about the products and

**OVERVIEW**

At the start of 2020, Philippines’s economy entered

th

its 84 quarter streak of growth in GDP. Since the

global pandemic outbreak, the economic took a
downturn, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
forecasting a drastic drop in GDP growth for 2020, at
negative 3.8% compared to 5.9% in 2019.


The economy is expected to bounce back in 2021,

1

with forecasted GDP growth at 6.8%. This is

supported by Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez,
promising an economic upturn between 7.1% - 8.1%,

2

resembling a sharp “V-Shaped” recovery.


Philippines’s GDP Per Capita is projected at
USD$3,537 in 2025, an increase of 24.5% from
USD$3,102.70 in 2018.

Philippines has a population of over 109 million, with
9.4 million or 8.6% of the population aged 60 and

3

above in 2020. According to a study by the

Philippines Institute for Development Studies, the
country is slowly becoming an ageing society. By
2032, those aged above 65 would reach above 7%
and by 2069, Philippines would become an “aged
society” with at least 14% of the population aged 65

## 6.Country Overview: PhilippinesCountry Overview: Australia

As of 2018, it is estimated that there are 726,864
people in the Philippines currently living with
dementia. This account to 13.3% of the total
population aged above 65 in 2018.

In a mixed method research conducted by Journal of
Clinical Epidemiology, the results were conclusive
that there is a lack of dementia care facilities. Out of
26 specially selected facilities, only one provided
specific care for dementia patients. Outpatient
services and community day care services were
scarce. There is a pressing need for more dementia
care facilities and services.

Based on Alzheimer’s Disease International recent
report – From Plan to Impact III (June 2020), it is
reported that Philippines yet to have a dementia plan
in place but it is embedded into the National Healthy
and Productive Ageing Plan with National Integrated
Dementia Plan and funded by World Health
Organization (WHO).

The life expectancy at birth is projected at 71.28

7

years, with healthy life expectancy projected at

8

61.71 years. With ten years of sub-health, the level

of care would increase over the years and this is
dependent on how well each individual manage their
health and mobility. In some cases, the individual
may require higher care, in the form of assisted living
services or even 24 hours residential care.


The government is targeting a 100% enrolment in
PhilHealth (the national health system) by 2020 and

11

making it fully mandatory.

In January 2020, the Philippines also finalised a
US$81billion (PHP4.1trillion) national budget with
US$3.2billlion (PHP164.7billion) allocated for the
health sector. The new budget marks a 12% increase
from the one in 2019. This “significant” increase from
the Department of Health is deemed a “positive” for
the Philippines’ healthcare sector and should provide
‘commercial opportunities for pharmaceutical firms

12

and healthcare providers’.

About half of the budget, US$1.3billion
(PHP67.4billion), will go to the Philippine Health
Insurance Corporation, US$1.1billion
(PHP59.6billion) will go to hospital services, and the
remaining $670million and (PHP34.2billion) to public
health services. Another US$810million
(PHP41.1billion) will go to the Health Facilities
Operations Programme.


2030, and that will make the Philippines an ageing

10

society based on the United Nations (UN) definition.

The rising ageing population eventually provides an
opportune time to invest in research relating to
ageing, which is a pre-requisite for anticipatory
policies and programmes that will ensure the
fulfilment of the Philippines’ 2030 Agenda pledge ‘to
leave no one behind’.


**INDUSTRY OUTLOOK**

Based on population projection, the Philippines is
projected to transition to an ageing population

There is also a prevalence of chronic diseases
amongst seniors, such as diabetes, cardiovascular
diseases and cancer. Because of this vulnerability to
chronic diseases, seniors need greater access to
healthcare facilities and treatments. However, not all
of them can afford or to have access to such
healthcare facilities. With hospitals being a primary
option for diagnosis, this could be a boost for the
market representing imaging and diagnostic
equipment.

Philippines rising ageing population will also create a
large demand for orthopaedic products and implants

14

and assistive devices market in the positive way.


Seeing the country's concerted effort to improve the
health and well-being of its population, the
Philippines healthcare and pharmaceutical market is
expected to experience a robust growth. The
healthcare expenditure in the Philippines is expected
to grow at a steady pace through to 2029, rising from
US$17.2billion (PHP897.4billion) to $60.7billion

12

(PHP3.1trillion).

**GOVERNMENT POLICIES & INITIATIVES**

The generally low economic status of seniors in
Philippines poses a challenge to policymakers and
programme managers to develop laws and
programme interventions to alleviate the plight of
their seniors in need.

Through the enactment of Republic Act No. (RA)
9994 or the Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010,
seniors are entitled to certain benefits and privileges.
Under the current Expanded Senior Citizen Act of
2010, senior citizens are entitled to a 20% discount
and exemption from value-added tax (VAT) on
medicines, professional fees from private hospitals,


home care providers and other health-care facilities,
medical and dental services, and diagnostic and
laboratory fees.

The seniors are also entitled to receive these
services as well as vaccination for free in all
government hospitals and health-care facilities
through the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. or
PhilHealth.

Aside from the entitlements, the law also covers the
seniors’ right to long-term and palliative care; the
right to education, training, lifelong learning, capacity
building; and the right to social security and social
protection.

There are currently five national laws related to
seniors in the Philippines. In 2019, the Philippines’
President Duterte signed the measure that created
the National Commission on Senior Citizens. This
also led to the abolition of the National Coordinating

15

Council and Monitoring Board.

The National Commission of Senior Citizens’ Act
coincides with the government’s policy to adopt
measures to assist the ageing population and to
show them appreciation.

This also allows the Government to establish
community-based health and rehabilitation,
educational and socio-economic programmes for all
of their senior citizens.

Through the National Commission of Senior Citizens’
Act, the State promotes the advocacy of and
collaboration between different stakeholders and
senior citizens to ensure the ‘effective
implementation of various programmes and services,
particularly on the development of senior citizens and
advancing their health and well-being, and ensuring a

supportive and enabling environment for the
seniors’.

**DEVELOPMENT OF ELDERCARE SERVICES &**
**SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES**

Most of the seniors in the Philippines live in Central
Luzon and Calabarzon, which has the highest
distribution of seniors at over a million or 13.3% of
the total population. Central Luzon has the secondhighest distribution, with over 879,000 or 11.6% of
the population. Metro Manila stands at the third, with

16

over 850,000 seniors or 11.3% of the population.


Currently the sector is only served by 20 to 25 private
nursing homes, with a combined capacity of between
300 beds to 500 beds, as well as a lot of Church-led
home-care institutions run by nuns and governmentowned facilities under the Department of Social

17

Welfare and Development.

With seven million seniors in the Philippines, about
90% of them are not really taken care of. By 2050,
the number of seniors is set to double from 8% to
16%. Such increase and the gap opens a lot of
opportunities for players in the geriatric care sector.

The reality of a possible increase in the number of
seniors requiring long-term care as the population
ages must be confronted now by preparing human
resources and facilities to provide the needed
services.

According to views from industry expert, by 2020 the
industry is looking at adding on an estimated 3,000 to
4,000 beds. However, the outlook will also depend on
current regulations and the cooperation of hospital

17

players.


**OVERVIEW OF FACILITIES IN PHILIPPINES**

Statistics from the Department of Social Welfare and
Development show that there are about 33 homes for
the aged - four are government-owned facilities, and
29 are accredited non-governmental organisations or
private social welfare agencies including Church-led
home-care institutions.

The RA No. 9994 provides for the establishment of a
geriatric ward in every government hospital. Centres
specialising in providing medical care for seniors
have been established. The Philippines also has the
National Center for Geriatric Health (NCGH), a
government facility that provides long-term care,
palliative care, and respite care to patients, including
those with dementia. The NCGH also provides
community-based geriatric health services and
training to the seniors and their families.

With multi-faceted roles, the NCGH also houses
post-graduate training and short-term courses to
medical doctors and allied medical professionals in
geriatrics and related fields, including programme
development and research on ageing-associated
diseases. The Centre also serves as a consultancy
and provides technical advice to geriatric wards,
nursing homes, and residential centres for senior
citizens.

**KEY CHALLENGES IN PHILIPPINES’ AGED CARE**
**SECTOR**

There are now several nursing homes in the country
that are run by both the private and public sector.
However, to majority of the Filipino population, it is
still considered a taboo to confine seniors in a care
facility.

Researches and findings have attributed that there is
a greater predisposition towards institutional living,
particularly amongst the older males and those in the
younger cohort (60–69). Most think that living in a
home for the aged is beneficial for seniors who

172

i i


-----

4[th] Asia Pacific Silver Economy
Business Opportunities Report
2020 Edition


## 6.Country Overview: PhilippinesCountry Overview: Australia

do not have anyone to care for them, and that the
older person’s health would be better taken care of
under such a setup.

The minority who do not approve of this living
arrangement believes that family members should
take care of seniors and be living with strangers.
Even though most of the seniors think having homes
for the aged is a good idea, more than three quarter

10

do not want to live in a care facility. The value of

utang na loob (debt of gratitude) remains strong
amongst older Filipinos.


With the impending growth of the ageing population,
the Philippines government is strengthening policy
support and programmes initiatives. Major policies
that grant benefits are already in place and
continuously being expanded to uphold the well
9

being of the senior population.

While the seniors in Philippines are accorded
numerous privileges and benefits, many still face
difficulties brought about by rising costs of living and
inefficient services.

Even though there is a high level of awareness
amongst the senior population about the government
programmes and the provision of the privileges,
awareness of these privileges does not automatically
translate to the use of services. Benefits and
privileges most used by seniors are those that they
find are readily available and deliberate needs, such
as the discounts on medicine and transportation and
lodging, as well as free medical and dental services.

In a longitudinal study of ageing and health in the
Philippines conducted by Economic Research
Institute for ASEAN and East Asia and Demographic
Research and Development Foundation, Inc, one of
the findings show that in a pre-ageing population, like


the Philippines, the idea of long-term care (LTC)
being handed over to non-family members, much
less to institutional facilities such as nursing homes,
is ‘not yet in the consciousness of the current cohort

10

of older Filipinos, some of whom may require LTC.

These social and cultural norms and the expected
rise in illnesses requiring long-term care that
accompany the trend towards further extensions in
life expectancy have suggested the need for more
support from the government, particularly in
promoting long-term care and institutional forms of
living arrangement for the older Filipinos.

While the family continues to be the main provider of
care for older Filipinos, changes in social and cultural
norms pose different challenges to the traditional
Filipino family structure and have gradually
weakened the traditional old-age support mechanism

10

that the older Filipinos need.

In summary, while the Philippines government has
put in place social protection policies and
programmes intended to secure the well-being of
seniors, greater effort must be exerted to cater to the
needs of the poor and vulnerable senior population.


**OPPORTUNITIES IN AGEING**

Philippines’ ageing population is set to increase at a
steady rate as seen from the Ageing Population
forecasted chart. Statistics from the Department of
Social Welfare and Development show that the aged
care sector is currently served by about 33 homes for
the aged.

With a huge discrepancy between the ageing
population and the services available, there exists the
opportunity for investors, operators and products/

173

service providers to fill.

Even as older Filipinos are warming up to the idea of
nursing homes, there is currently a lack of home care
services. This gap can serve as an opportunity for
those looking to enter the aged care market to tap on.

**OVERVIEW**

Republic of Korea’s economy is the fourth largest in
Asia and 12th largest in the world. Over the past four
decades, the country has made huge economic

industrialised economy. Republic of Korea has been
a major player globally in trade and industrialisation.

According to Trading Economics’ Ease of Doing
Business rankings, Republic of Korea is ranked fifth

1

as of 2019. The economic culture in Republic of

Korea is one of friendliness with other economies,
and has seen able to attract investors from all across

2

the globe despite its corporate tax rate of 25%.


Due to the impact of the global pandemic crisis,
Republic of Korea’s GDP in 2020 is expected to
experience a recession with decrease by negative
2.1% to US$1.61 trillion as forecasted by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its recent

3

economic outlook update in June 2020. The

economy is expected to progress into a steady
recovery of 3% to US$1.66 trillion in 2021.

Republic of Korea has a population of over 51 million,

Compared to our 2015 report, healthy life expectancy
has increased by 2 years from 71 years and this is a
significant improvement compared to the other
countries in the region.


seniors stay independent and connected to the
society. Senior care facilities will have to alter care
models to adapt to this trend.

According to the National Institute of Health in
Republic of Korea, the number of person with
dementia in the country is expected to exceed one

9

million in 2024 and three million in 2025. The

number is an alarming increase as compared to our
2015 report, where the estimated number of persons
with dementia was forecasted at close to one million
in 2030. According to the Central Dementia Centre,
Ministry of Health and Welfare in Republic of Korea,
the national dementia management cost is US$12.3
billion, whereas the average annual management
cost of a dementia patient is US$17,500 based on
the article released in June 2019.

In 2019, 41% of total medical costs in Republic of
Korea is spent on senior healthcare. The record-high
figure of US$26.8 billion marked a huge increase of
12.4% in 2018. The seniors spent an average of
US$3,800 alone in 2019.


**INDUSTRY OUTLOOK**

In Republic of Korea, most seniors are taken care of
by the family members, who are seen to be the
primary caregivers. This has been dictated by values
of Confucianism, which is a huge part of Korea
culture. However, over the recent years, this mindset
is starting to change. According to a study conducted
by Korean Women’s Development Institute in 2014,
16.6% of Koreans feel that an individual should be
self-sufficient financially in their golden years.

At the same time, children who feel that they should
be financially responsible for their ageing parents
dropped by almost half, from 70.7% to 31.7% in 2002
as compared to 2014 study. The respondents who
felt that the government should share the cost with
the children increased to 47.3% in 2014 from 18.2%

7

in 2002.


Changes in the family structure is another trend in
Korea, resulting in higher numbers of single senior
households or those that choose to live alone. In
Seoul alone, the number of seniors living alone

8

stands at 27.7% in 2015. This can be attributed to

changing lifestyle preferences, where there is a
desire for independence and personal space.

With this shift, it is imperative for the government to
consider interventions that address this transposition.
Re-employment, ageing-in-place, opportunities for
education and active ageing policies will help these


The expected increase in the number of seniors in
the coming years will put pressure on the fiscal

10

sustainability of the healthcare system.

Restructuring of the healthcare system through a
community-centred medical system and introduction
of policies that encourage healthier living will be
needed to bring this figure down. There would be an
emerging market for preventive healthcare, health
food and nutrition in Republic of Korea as an
alternative to escalating healthcare costs in the
country.

**GOVERNMENT POLICIES & INITIATIVES**

In 2006, the Ministry of Health and Welfare

i i


176

Business Opportunities Report
2020 Edition


## 6.Country Overview: Republic of KoreaCountry Overview: Australia

introduced three Five-year plans to address the
demographic relevant issues caused by low birth-rate
and ageing population. The first policy is
implemented for the year 2006-2010; second policy
for the year 2011-2015; and finally, the third policy for
the year 2016-2020. Collaboration between multiple
government ministries will be involved, including the
Ministry of Labour & Employment.

**1st Basic Plan on Aging Society and Population**
**(2006 – 2010)**
The 1st Basic Plan on Aging Society and Population

11

(2006-2010) was announced in 2016 with an aim to

ensure the sustainable growth of Republic of Korea
by creating a childbirth and childcare-friendly
environment, in addition to laying the groundwork for
a response system to the ageing society.

The policy targets low-income seniors aged over 65
and established the framework for income security.
This will ensure financial stability post-retirement and
subsidised medical care for seniors by introducing
Basic Old Age Pension (2007) and care support by
establishing the Long-term Care Insurance for Senior
Citizens (2008).

The policy will address the need to improve health
and medical security for seniors. The new system will
introduce a senior-friendly society through preventive
healthcare activities for seniors. This will result in a
healthier post-retirement life, reduced medical costs
for senior care and enhanced support system for
medical treatment and care.

The policy introduced the Promotion of SeniorFriendly Industries Act (2008) to encourage the
utilisation of a senior workforce and encourage
development of senior-friendly businesses. This will
help to encourage more job creations that are seniorfriendly, removing barriers that discourage seniors


The enhanced policy aims to ensure a stable postretirement life for seniors. For employability and postretirement years, the policy directive included a
revised law to raise the mandatory retirement age to

12

60 in May 2013. From 2016, the law will take effect

and all companies with more than 300 workers, as

i i


from re-joining the labour market and educational
programmes to help seniors develop competencies
required in labour market. This will encourage senior
citizens to participate actively in the working
population post-retirement.

The policy looks into the development of seniorfriendly environment in areas as housing,
transportation, entertainment areas so as to promote
active ageing and prevent social isolation.

Major challenges that the government of Republic of
Korea faced in the first phase includes the lack of
participation from the private sector despite the
government’s emphasis on nationwide participation.
The practice of early retirement still exists despite the
job promotion for seniors. Another major challenge is
the disproportionate focus and lack of improvement
in policies for addressing the potential effects of an
ageing society.

**2nd Basic Plan on Aging Society and Population**
**(2011 – 2015)**
The second basic plan (2011-2015) is an expanded
plan based on the outcome and limitations of the first
plan. The policy continues to focus on Republic of
Korea becoming an energetic, advanced country by
tackling the issues of an ageing society in the long
run. This will help to improve the quality of life and
ensure the substantiality of the nation. Targeting
baby boomers aged over 50, the plan focuses on a
more comprehensive system covering income, health
and housing.

well as public organisations will have to abide.

The policy provides diverse employment
opportunities including re-employment, job change
and funding for business start-ups. This will ensure a
stable source of income for seniors in order to
enhance public and private pension systems.
Standardised programmes that support retirees
during post-retirement are being developed to ensure
stability and an active post-retirement life.

The enhanced policy seeks to establish preventive
medical care system to ensure healthier lives for
senior citizens and stabilise future medical costs for
senior care. It includes improved medical coverage
for seniors that will reduce their burden of medical
bills and stabilise medical costs which will likely to
increase in the wake of an ageing society.

The policy plans to enhance the social infrastructure,
including housing and transportation to be more
senior-friendly.

The implementation of social protection systems in
place for the vulnerable seniors who live alone, or
face abuse are also underway.

**Seoul 50+**

13

Seoul 50+ is an initiative launched in 2016 during

the period of the third policy (2016-2020). The policy
is aimed at the demographic age group between 50
years and 64 years.

The effort for this initiative is spearheaded by the
Seoul Metropolitan Government to address the
challenge of an ageing society. The aim is to enable
the 50-plus generation to remain active and support
them in creating new life models for themselves as
they age.


Seoul’s 50+ policy provides life–long training,
emotional support, cultural experience and also retraining for continued social opportunities for the
newly retired. The initiative creates and promotes
new 50+ job models for the public and private sector,
by expanding socially meaningful job models such as
paid volunteer jobs and operating 50+ start-up
venture competitions, incubation and encore outplacement programmes.

A comprehensive ecosystem to support this policy is
planned across Seoul. This infrastructure includes
the Seoul50+ Foundation central body and several
50+ campuses and centres. These locations will be
built in collaboration with organisations from both the
not-for-profit and private sector.

These centres are reflective of the local heritage in
which it is built upon and will address the needs of
seniors in the local district. The campuses are bigger
one-stop shops that offer individualised services
including counselling, education and new job models.
The infrastructure provides support and cultural
space for those aged 50 and above to interact with
their peers, drive change, and generate needs-based
service for one another.

In 2017, the 50+ programme received more than
15,000 seniors and has helped to organise 112
senior communities all across the country. More than
600 seniors have participated in 13 different job
streams and 50+ campuses have provided more than
300 courses to seniors.

Despite the positive outlook, the 2018 report from the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) emphasized the need for more
collaborative effort between the legislation and the
institutional to ensure success of the policy.

Producing a paradigm shifts in the newly retiring
urban populations on what new life is like after
retirement takes time as post-retirement life would
markedly be different from the previous generations.

**Community Care Policy**
The government of the Republic of Korea has
announced plans for expanding care services to
seniors in their homes by 2025. The plan is
envisaged in the framework of the “Community Care”
policy. Spearheaded by the Ministry of Health and
Welfare in the context of population ageing, the
government plan to achieve an alternative to
confinement in medical institutions or nursing homes
for seniors and to cater to dependent seniors staying
at home.

Under the policy, the Government is offering an
additional 40,000 units of public silver housing by
2022 and will provide subsidies on housing costs for
needy seniors. 5,000 units of will be reserved for the

14

low-income seniors who are living alone. These

houses will be located near public health care
establishments and equipped with safety devices
such as automatic gas cut-offs.

The Government will expand the network of
community health care centres throughout the
country to increase the number of seniors receiving
home health care services from 1.25 million to 3.93
million by 2025. The Government wishes to increase
the ratio of aged people being covered by life care
insurance in order to meet the OECD standards.

**DEVELOPMENT OF ELDERCARE SERVICES &**
**SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES**

The changing demographics, economy and culture of


Republic of Korea will create demand for senior
housing. With pension income becoming more
prevalent, attitudes towards co-residence is changing
and seniors opt for privacy and independence.

In a survey of urban residents conducted by the
Journal of Property Investment & Finance, it was
highlighted that seniors of a higher socio-economic
status are more likely to live in seniors living facilities.
The key features that these seniors look for will
include personal care, home care, social and security

15

services.

**OVERVIEW OF FACILITIES IN REPUBLIC OF**
**KOREA**

The development of residential communities or
housing complexes known as silver towns started in
1988, where independent seniors live together and
care for themselves and those in their community.
Organisations will provide seniors with socialisation
and leisure activities and some form of home care
assistance is provided to those who require it. All-inone silver towns are becoming increasingly popular
as an option for senior housing.

The demand for long-term care facilities has increase
significantly where there were 1,754 facilities in 2008
and increased to 5,163 in 2016. The care recipients
have also increased from 214,480 (4.2% of ageing
population aged 65 and above) in 2008 to 467,752
(7%) in 2015.[16]

With the ageing population, along with the number of
persons with dementia forecasted to grow
exponentially, there is still a lack of facilities across
the country to meet the increasing demand for aged
care and residential care.

**Ageing Asia Curated Facilities**

**Aria Care Korea**
Aria Care Korea provides home and nursing care
services for senior beneficiaries of long-term care
insurance who have difficulty living alone due to
dementia or other geriatric disorders. With the
mission of “Practicing true social filial piety”, ICT
technology is applied to the existing nursing care.
Using care technologies, they have developed an
advanced care system to cater for the seniors.

**Borin Housing**
Jointly supported by the Geumcheon-gu district
government, the Seoul Metropolitan Government
(SMG), and Seoul Housing and Communities
Corporation (SH Corp), Borin Housing is a shared
housing facility available on public lease for senior
citizens over 65 years of age and living alone.

The name Borin means ‘to protect neighbours’. The
seniors in Borin Housing live in a shared space so
that they can protect and take care of one another. In
a shared house, residents share a living room,
kitchen and other common areas but have their own
bedroom and bathroom. While this type of housing is
quite common in Europe and Japan, Seoul was the
first city in Republic of Korea to introduce such
dwellings in 2013. By accommodating multiple
households and sharing spaces, this type of dwelling
encourages and promotes community living.

A fairly new concept for seniors in Seoul, all four
Borin Housing projects (56 households) are currently
located in Geumcheon-gu. Since 2016, the concept
has been implemented by local Gu governments in
Seoul and nationwide. Borin Housing tenants pay a
deposit of around KRW 10 million (US$8,450), rent of
KRW 60,000–70,000 (US$50 – US$60) per month,
and a small miscellaneous fee as maintenance costs.


**Gangnam-gu Haengbok Convalescence Hospital**
The project was completed in 2014, in Gangnam,
Seoul. The sites spans across an area of 6,454m2
and is jointly collaborated by Gansam Architect &
Partners, Hyunshin Architects and Engineers and
EGA Group.

While getting away from the typical image of
hospitals for seniors, the hospital provides a cosy
home-like residence space and suggests a new
model for public medical facilities by offering a
patient-centred healing environment with a healthy
and fresh living space.

Reminiscence therapy plays a huge part in the
background as it has a space which displays traces
of life and time of seniors. This is similar to growth
rings that emerge one by one through the beautiful
cycle of time and the seasons.

**Injain Care Centre**
The centre is on the corner of a park and stands out
due to its five-story height and European style
design. The building is jagged with gabled roofs on
top in order to create a “home-like interior for the
seniors”.

The aim is to provide “a centre where retirees can
live with dignity”. The Injain Care Centre located in
Bucheon is one of the few facilities in Korea that has
adopted the “Unit Care system” – rooms are built into
“units” that resemble a house with five bedrooms,
common bathroom and a common living room. The
unit is the responsibility of one caretaker. Instead of
looking like a hospital with all of the rooms opening
onto a long corridor, the unit design mimics a flat or
house.

The 180 beds Injain Care Centre was opened in

November 2015. The design includes the flat-like
communal living described above, and boasts a
disability-friendly environment for those who have
difficulty moving or are wheelchair bound. There are
doors without thresholds, bathrooms with safety bars,
an outdoor garden to grow vegetables, a sauna and
foot bath equipment in a physical therapy room.

**KB Golden Life Care**
A subsidiary of KB Insurance on nursing industry,
opened ‘Wirye Village’, an advanced country-style
nursing home for the first time in financial district. It is
a 2nd nursing home, following the first nursing home
called ‘Gangdong Care Centre’ which opened in
December 2016.

It is a nursing home that supports the daily life of
seniors who has difficulty in living alone for 24 hours.
Unlike the original nursing homes locating in
countryside with bad accessibility, Wirye Village is
located in the centre of city with good accessibility. In
consideration of customers’ convenience, it provides
secure and advanced nursing infrastructure. As such,
it takes the lead in helping seniors revitalise their
retirement preparation due to ageing.

**Samsung Nobel County**
Opened by Samsung Life Public Welfare Foundation
in May 2001, Samsung Nobel County is different
from previous care institutions. The facility is a new
concept of Continuing Care Retirement Community
(CCRC) incorporating - A combination of housing,
medicine, culture and sports in the style of retirement
facilities in developed countries.

Samsung Noble County occupies approximately 55
acres of land and serves up to 540 households. It is
located near Suwon Young tong New City, and
features convenient and comfortable housing and
medical facilities, as well as cultural and sports


**Seoul Bukbu Geriatric Hospital**
This is a specialised hospital for seniors established
by Seoul City for the first time. It comprises of two
underground floors and four floors above ground and

has a scale in total land area of 18,000 m and with a

capacity of 200 beds. These are operated in eight
main departments including internal medicine,
neurology, rehabilitation medicine, psychiatry, family
medicine, anaesthesia pain medicine,
ophthalmology, and diagnostic radiology. An artificial
kidney centre is operated separately for patients with
kidney failure. A variety of medical services are
provided by operating health screening centres for all
the generations from students to seniors.

There is specialised rehabilitation for seniors' care
services such as work therapy, speech therapy,
thermal and electrical therapy, exercise therapy,
entertainment therapy, music therapy, art therapy

181

i i


leisure facilities and others for comprehensive
catering of needs in life after retirement.

Residents normally lead their life in the Living House,
and use the facilities (Culture Centre, Sports Centre,
etc.), and in the case where health deteriorates or
constant care is required, residents can move into
the Nursing Home and receive professional care
service.

**Senior Health Town**
The government-run Bitgoeul, meaning the "town of
light," Senior Health Town is Asia's largest
recreational, learning and health care centre for the
seniors. It is a unique landmark of senior welfare in
Republic of Korea. The health centre is dubbed as “
Seniors’ Paradise” as it provides more than 90 free or
low-cost programmes, and the complex has more
than 5,000 daily attendees and over 54,400
registered members.

and laughter therapy. In addition, there are places
that the seniors can rest comfortably and are well
prepared such as Acupressure park, Bamboo park,
Sky park, Trail park, Lounge and Visitor’s floor.

Personalised and tailored diets are offered and
dietary education is also provided for patients with
hypertension and diabetes. Seoul Bukbu Geriatric
Hospital is committed to medical treatment as well as
rehabilitation, medical care and nutrition counselling
for acute care hospitalisation and long-term medical
therapy. They provide effective health education and
rehabilitation services for the patients who is
discharged from general hospitals and university
hospitals after receiving hospital treatment in geriatric
disease or illness without full recovery.

30% of the suites are on rental basis, whereas the
other 70% is owned.


the backdrop of a nature-friendly ecological
environment with the best facilities and with a view of
mountains and streams for seniors and families
suffering physically and mentally. It is the one of the
best nursing care hospital for seniors which
combines health, hobby, and leisure as well as drug
therapy with rehabilitation care.

For patients, each ward has created a cosy
atmosphere similar to a home environment, and all
staffs engage in care and nursing with the same
heart as a family member so that patients can live a
comfortable life.

There is a Uiseong Dementia Public Hospital colocated that focused on embracing nature. In the
same way that the ‘che’ in Hanok is organised, day
rooms and wards are clustered together, and
“Healing Courtyard” is constructed as an inner
courtyard inspired by the spatial layout of Korean
traditional architecture. The “Strolling Passage”
around the courtyard helps Alzheimer patients under
rehabilitation to regain their strength.

**Yudang Village**
The first silver town located in Suwon, opened in
1988, after amendments in senior welfare laws that
allowed the creation of for-profit senior facilities. Most
of the silver towns are designed to meet each and
every need a senior resident could have; they have a
restaurant that serves three meals a day, a
swimming pool, fitness centre, clinic, beauty salon,
sauna, karaoke, computer room, library, audio-visual
room and billiards room.

They offer services such as organised group
activities and field trips, as well as cleaning and the
laundry services. The centres are often associated
with or have contracts with hospitals so that the
residents can easily seek medical help, when

182

i i


The clinic is open 24 hours and has a doctor, nurses
and 4 physiotherapists onsite. For the wealthy, this
facility includes numerous amenities such as a large
swimming pool, four hot tubs, auditorium, library,
games room, etc. and is functionally laid out. All of
the suites are oriented to the south which is very
important to Koreans. This results in single loaded
corridor with windows on the corridor walls opposite
the suites. The owner, Dr Jong Kyun Lee, also owns
a 140 bed nursing home and a 120 bed hospital that
includes 60 nursing beds. In Korea, only medical
doctors or doctors’ associations are allowed to own
private hospitals.

**Uiseong Nursing Hospital**
The nursing hospital is a senior medical welfare
hospital established in Uiseong-gun. It is set against

required. They provide personalised fitness and
health programmes as well as bi-annual health
check-ups.

Nurses are stationed around the clock for emergency
situations. All the housing units have sensors that set
off an alarm if a person does not move for a certain
amount of time and the environment is seniorfriendly, where corridors are wheelchair accessible
and the floor of the bathrooms are made of non-slip
materials.

Silver towns are often made up of a single building,
so it might take time to move from one location to
another. The towns will combine advanced
information technologies aiming to be a welfare
centre for all generation.

**KEY CHALLENGES IN REPUBLIC OF KOREA**
**AGED CARE SECTOR**

The key challenge in the ageing market in Republic
of Korea would be the high proportion of vulnerable
seniors. The poverty rate for seniors aged above 65
is at 63.3% in 2015. In order to make ends meet,
many seniors chose to be employed, albeit in lowpaying jobs. In a report by Korea Development Bank
in 2018, up to 31% of seniors have low-wage jobs.[17]

Another trend observed amongst seniors is their
willingness to spend. The average propensity to
spend at 2016 is 67.2%, falling short when compared
to countries such as Japan and United States of
America. This trend is accelerated by the country’s
longer life expectancy, where seniors are saving to
prepare for living into 80s.[18]

With more senior citizens working, Republic of Korea
has one of the highest senior employment rates at


30.6% in 2015.[19] These seniors can be upskilled
through education courses, allowing them to earn a
decent wage and escape the poverty cycle. With
higher income security, seniors will be willing to
spend, generating an opportunity in the aged care
sector.

The escalating medical cost for senior healthcare and
the rapid growth of the ageing population and the
person with dementia, will put pressure on the
financial sustainability to both the government and
the seniors themselves.

The government will have to ramp up their social and
economic initiatives to address the changing needs
and financial security of the ageing population.

**OPPORTUNITIES IN AGEING**

With changing demographic trends and new
government initiatives, aged care is set to become a
thriving industry in Korea. The lack of senior care
facilities in Republic of Korea presents operators and
investors an opportunity to enter the market, in
addition to the demand for dementia care services
and ageing technologies to enable seniors to live
independently and safely on their own.

The country’s strong economy and high-income level
presents an opportunity for the seniors or their family
members to consider the senior living facilities and
aged care products and services to support the
seniors to age well, with their families or
independently on their own.

As more children’s mindset is changing towards
ageing independently, senior living facilities may see
a boom in demand as these children may opt to place
their parents in these facilities or to stay there

themselves when they age.

With reforms to the healthcare and economic system,
seniors will be more willing to spend in the years to
come. The Korean baby boomers will drive change in
the aged care sector in the next five years as they
are more affluent, educated and lifestyle-focused

20

compared to their predecessors. The longer life

expectancy and healthy life years would drive the
demand of healthy-living and lifestyle ageing-related
products and services, in addition to the traditional
senior care services.

## 6.Country Overview: SingaporeCountry Overview: Australia

Singaporeans are living longer and healthier due to a
health-conscious society and a better chronic
disease management strategy which has paid off,
largely through efforts in early prevention and
detection of such diseases.

By 2030, 1.8 million or 29.7% of the population will be
aged 60 and over and by 2050, 2.5 million or 40.2%
of the population will be aged 60 and over.

In 2020, Singapore tripled their healthcare

6

expenditure to S$12 billion as compared to S$4

billion in 2010, in order to meet the evolving needs of
our seniors and for every Singapore to have access
to affordable and quality healthcare.

According to the Singapore 2020 Budget
announcements by Ministry of Finance, the budget is
mainly to cater for the growth in patient subsidies as
Singapore expands clinical services and capacity,
and enhance quality through improved training and
retention of healthcare professionals.

In addition, the government aims to improve
affordability for Singaporeans through premium
support for MediShield Life as well as other forms of
grants and financial assistance. It also includes
provisional funding for contingency plans and
measures for the prevention, containment and control
of COVID-19 by the Ministry of Health and the
healthcare sector.

**INDUSTRY OUTLOOK**

The trend of increasing demand for health and aged
care services will continue as Singapore’s population
ages. A projected 6.1% of the budget will be
allocated for the Health Promotion and Preventive
Healthcare Programme. The total sum of US$522.7


million (S$710.14 million) allocated to the Health
Promotion and Preventive Healthcare Programme
will focus on programmes that seek to prevent or
reduce the incidences and prevalence of ill health by
preventing the development of diseases and
promoting early detection and management of
diseases.

Singapore’s rapidly ageing population is expected to
drive the increment in the government expenditure on
healthcare. Although Singapore has achieved good
outcomes in healthcare with a cost-effective system,
while providing good care, the government is
spending an increasing percentage of its income on
healthcare. This to ensure that healthcare services
continue to maintain accessible and affordable,
through regular reviews on their social safety nets
and provision of adequate healthcare facilities.

By 2030, one in three Singaporeans are expected to
be over 60. The vision for the Government’s rising
national care bill is ensure provision of adequate
healthcare facilities and regular reviews of our social
safety nets.

The provision of US$1.256 billion (S$1.71 billion) for
development expenditure in 2020 is US$ 145.9
million (S$198.21 million) or 13.1% higher than the
revised 2019 development expenditure of US$1.11
billion (S$1.51 billion). The increase in budget
provision for development expenditure in 2020 is
mainly due to higher cashflows required for major
projects such as Woodlands Health Campus,
Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Emergency
Medicine Building, SGH Elective Care Centre as well
as information technology (IT) infrastructure of new
healthcare facilities and other major IT projects.

According to the Well-Being of the Singapore Elderly
study led by the Institute of Mental Health in 2015,

one in ten people aged 60 and above may have

7

dementia. By 2017, it affected over 78,000

people, and the ratio increases to one in two for

8

those aged 85 and above.


By 2018, almost 82,000 and the number is expected
to rise to over 130,000 in 2030 and 241,000 by 2050.
In Singapore, an estimated US$2,1 billion (S$2.8
billion) was spent on dementia and this figure is
estimated to almost triple by 2030.

In 2020, the Alzheimer’s Disease Association

10

(ADA) in Singapore introduced Spoc-19, or

‘Support for Persons living with dementia Over the
COVID-19 period’, identifiers were given out to
persons with dementia, so that enforcement
authorities can recognise them easier and offer
assistance. Individuals with dementia and their
caregivers can register for Spoc-19. This will allow
members of the public or ground enforcement
authorities to easily recognise individuals with
dementia and offer appropriate assistance.

One of these three 'identifiers' is a new memo from
the ADA which states the individual and caregiver's
names and explains that the individual may lack the
ability to adhere circuit breaker measures. While this
does not give the memo holder immunity, it allows
enforcement officers to be aware of the individual's
condition and provide the appropriate assistance.

With one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the
world at 17% plus a host of other tax schemes and
incentives, Singapore is one of the best countries in
Asia for firms to grow their businesses. The country
welcomes businesses to leverage Singapore as a
strategic vantage base with schemes such as the
Land Intensification Allowance (LIA), Integrated
Investment Allowance (IIA), Pioneer Incentive,
Finance & Treasury Centre (FTC) Tax Incentive and


much more.

**GOVERNMENT POLICIES & INITIATIVES**

The key policy direction in Singapore is to encourage
active ageing to enable successful ageing-in-place
and community care. As Singaporeans age,
additional social, health and care services will be
provided into their homes, and when the need arises
for advanced care needs, day service centres,
nursing homes and hospital capacities will be
progressively increased to address the population
demands.

**The Action Plan for Successful Ageing**
Singapore has taken a whole-of-nation approach to
preparing for population ageing. A Ministerial
Committee on Ageing was established to coordinate
government policies and programmes relating to
population ageing.

In 2015, the Committee launched an Action Plan for
Successful Ageing which forms the nation’s blueprint
for preparing Singaporeans to age well. The formal

11

US$2.2 billion (S$3 billion) plan was launched in

2016 with 70 initiatives across 12 areas in 12 areas –
health and wellness, learning, volunteerism,
employment, housing, transport, public spaces,
respect and social inclusion, retirement adequacy,
healthcare and aged care, protection for vulnerable
seniors and research.

The plan had input from 4,000 people in Singapore,
including voluntary welfare and non-profit
organisations, academia, businesses and union
members, and public consultation feedback. It
includes moves such as raising the re-employment
age from 65 to 67 by 2017, building another 40
daycentres for seniors by 2020, and setting up a

National Silver Academy to help seniors pursue their
interests.

According to Mr Gan Kim Yong, Minister-in-Charge of
Ageing and Chairman of the Ministerial Committee
on Ageing, he said, “We need to plan ahead to
ensure that Singaporeans need not worry about
getting old but instead embrace new opportunities
that come with longevity. We want Singapore to be
the best place for Singaporeans to grow old in, and a
model for successful ageing.”

Singapore’s vision of a Senior Friendly City works at
three levels: national, community and individual. At
the national level, Singapore aims to be a City for All
Ages. At the community level, Singapore wants to be
a Kampong for All Ages. At the individual level,
Singapore promises Opportunities for All Ages.

Singapore aspires to be a home which enables its
seniors to continue to grow and develop as

12

individuals, even in their later years.

   - **Opportunities for All Ages - Singapore will**
be a place where everyone, including seniors,
can continually learn, grow and achieve their
fullest potential.

   - **Kampong for All Ages - Singapore will be a**
caring and inclusive society that respects and
embraces seniors as an integral part of our
cohesive community.

   - **City for all Ages - Singapore will be**
distinctive globally not just for its economic
success, but also as a model for successful
ageing.


system to meet the changing and varied needs of
senior in a rapidly ageing society. As population
ageing picks up speed in the next decade, Singapore
aims to build up a strong community-based support
system that can achieve three main goals:

   - Keep our seniors physically and cognitively
well for as long as possible, so that they enjoy
their golden years.

   - Ensure seniors are socially connected with the
community, pre-empting loneliness and
isolation.

   - Enable seniors to age well in place for as long
as possible, minimising unnecessary acute
care episodes or premature institutionalisation
in nursing homes.

Singapore has a Community Networks for Seniors
(CNS) initiative which is their national “communitybased care system”. This national effort brings
together a network of different stakeholders in the
community, in every constituency—voluntary welfare
organisations (VWOs), the People’s Association (PA)
grassroots organisations, regional health systems
and government agencies—so that seniors can get
help quickly and in a coordinated manner.

In support of this vision, Ministry of Health and
Agency for Integrated Care are building a community
care system with four key layers: proactive outreach,
health and wellness, community support, as well as
senior-centric help and accessible care services.

Singapore’s vision is a community-based support
system that is:

   - **proactive in going upstream to support**
seniors, pre-empting issues of social isolation

and ill health more effectively;

   - **broad-based in serving seniors, beyond**
those who are low-income and frail; and

   - **integrated in weaving together social and**
health support to support seniors.

**Key Healthcare Financing Schemes**

**CareShield Life**
CareShield Life is a new basic long term insurance
scheme that features higher payouts that increase
over time with no cap on payout duration, to provide
better protection and assurance against the
uncertainty of long term care costs if a senior
becomes severely disabled.

In 2020, ElderShield will be replaced by CareShield
Life. ElderShield will no longer be available to new
cohorts turning 40 from 2020 onwards (those born in
1980 or later) but will continue to operate for existing
cohorts who are already enrolled, if they have chosen
to continue the ElderShield plan.

CareShield Life will be universal and mandatory for
all Singaporeans and PRs born in 1980 or later. This
is to ensure that everyone will have access to basic
protection for long-term care needs.

**ElderShield**
ElderShield was introduced in 2002 as a severe
disability insurance scheme that aims to provide
basic financial protection to Singaporeans who need
long-term care, especially in old age. It was
introduced to help supplement Singaporeans’ savings
in the event of severe disability.

Ministry of Health estimates that one in two
Singaporeans who are healthy at the age of 65 will


go on to develop a long-term disability.

In 2020, CareShield Life was launched to replace
ElderShield.

**MediShield Life**
MediShield Life is a basic health insurance plan that
protects all Singapore Citizens and Permanent
Residents against large hospital bills for life,
regardless of age or health condition. It is
administered by the Central Provident Fund (CPF)
Board, which helps to pay for large hospital bills and
selected costly outpatient treatments, such as
dialysis and chemotherapy for cancer. It is structured
so that patients pay less MediSave/ cash for large
hospital bills.

**MediSave**
MediSave is a national medical savings scheme that
helps individuals set aside part of their income to pay
for their personal or approved dependents’
hospitalisation, day surgery and certain outpatient
expenses, as well as their healthcare needs in old
age.

**Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS)**
CHAS enables all Singapore Citizens,
including Pioneer Generation and Merdeka
Generation cardholders, to receive subsidies for
medical and/ or dental care at participating General
Practitioner (GP) and dental clinics. More than 1.2
million Singaporeans are covered under the CHAS
scheme for outpatient visits.

**Key grants to support caregiving at home for**

assistive devices and home healthcare items.

**Home Caregiving Grant (HCG)**
The Home Caregiving Grant replaces the Foreign
Domestic Worker (FDW) Grant from October 2019.
Home Caregiving Grant (HCG) can be used to defray
the costs of caregiving expenses, such as the costs
of aged care and caregiver support services in the
community or hiring of a Foreign Domestic Worker
(FDW). The HCG is a monthly cash payout of
US$147 (S$200).

**Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) Levy**
**Concession for Persons with Disabilities**
The FDW Levy Concession for Persons with
Disabilities is to support households who need to hire
FDW to care for seniors and disabled persons by
paying a lower monthly concessionary FDW levy. A
concessionary FDW levy rate of $60.

**Caregivers Training Grant (CTG)**
The CTG supports caregivers of seniors and those
with disability, including family members and Foreign
Domestic Workers (FDW), to attend caregiver
training courses so that they can equip themselves
with the necessary skills in caring for the physical
and emotional needs of their care recipients. The
CTG provides subsidies of up to $200 per eligible
care recipient per financial year.

**DEVELOPMENT OF ELDERCARE SERVICES &**
**SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES**

In 2012, the Ministry of Health launched the
Healthcare 2020 Masterplan with the target of
reaching 17,000 nursing home places and 10,000

scheme is built by Housing Development Board
(HDB) and subsequently merged with 2-room Flats
Scheme. Since 2002, HDB has launched a total of
9,119 studio apartments.

These apartments are built with a specific purpose –
to serve the senior population aged 55 years and
above. Senior citizens are able to choose the lease
duration on their 2-room flat. This is based on several
criteria, such as their age, needs and preferences.
Seniors aged 55 and above can choose to take a
lease between 15 to 45 years in 5-year increments.

The lease must cover the seniors and their spouse
up to a minimum age of 95 years. For first-timer
singles as well as first- and second-timer families, the
new two-room flats can be bought on a 99-year
lease.

In November 2015, the scheme was replaced by the
two-room Flexi Scheme. Under the new scheme,
every Build-To-Order (BTO) project will have at least
40 percent or a minimum of 100 units of two-room
flexi flats specifically assigned for seniors. A total of
9,147 2-Room Flexi Flats were launched between
November 2015 and May 2017. Expecting
completion in 2021, these units are currently under
construction progressively. Overall, HDB will build a
total of 10,994 units of studio apartments and twoRoom Flexi Flats for seniors from 2019 to 2021.

16

added 778 places. With Singapore’s increasing

focus on community care, the number of day care
facility places increased from 2017 at 5,000 places to
7,600 places by 2019. The home care places also
increased from 8,000 to 10,300 in the same period.

The costs of staying in a nursing home in Singapore

household means test. This test considers the
following factors: Gross income of the person who
needs care, his/her spouse and all family members
living in the same household; and total number of
family members living in the same household.

Alternatively, if the household does not have an
income, the following is considered: Annual value of
the place of residence. This test is also used for
schemes such as Community Health Assist Scheme
(CHAS) and Senior’s Mobility and Enabling Fund
(SMF). The benchmark criteria are the monthly per
capita household income ceiling of US$9,285
(S$13,000) - computed as the total gross household
monthly income divided by total number of family
members living together in the household. Gross
monthly household income includes basic
employment income, trade/self-employed income,

facility that provides a homely and social environment
for seniors, where they can live with autonomy and
dignity. With close access to medical care and
community support, they offer a safe and warm
environment for a new generation of seniors.

It was started when Dr Joseph Lee and Dr Belinda
Wee noticed a need of a group of seniors, who
wished to live in a community and in the vicinity of
medical services. These were seniors who wanted to
remain active and engaged in their usual activities
even with age. The emphasis at St Bernadette’s is to
help seniors keep up with what they normally do cook, clean, water the plants, wash up, therefore
empowering them to live full lives.

There are currently three assisted living facilities
operated by St Bernardette in Singapore. As an

activities is planned every week to keep the seniors
socially engaged and active.

**St. Joseph’s Home**
St. Joseph’s Home was set up by the Catholic
Welfare Services in 1978 to provide shelter, care and
love for the aged and destitute, regardless of race or
religion. It was the late Dr. Ee Peng Liang’s vision
and untiring efforts that made this possible. The
Canossian Sisters volunteered their services for the
administration and running of the Home. They were
fully involved right from the beginning of its
conception to the present day-to-day care of the
residents.

The redevelopment of St Joseph's Home took two
and a half years and the project was completed in
end-2016, with a soft opening in 2017. Capacity
increased from 130 in the former single-storey
compound to 412 beds in a six-storey complex.

St Joseph's Home, is also the first in Singapore to
integrate a childcare centre into a nursing home. A
common canteen area and an inter-generational
playground with a wheelchair-friendly see-saw were
built to foster social interaction between the children
and the residents. To better serve the community,
more new services such as the Dusk-to-Dawn (night
respite programme) and hydropool have also been
introduced.

**St Luke’s Eldercare (SLEC)**
Founded in August 1999, St Luke's Eldercare (SLEC)
was set up with a vision to provide services and
programmes that will enable the seniors to age
gracefully at home and in the communities.

Through their nursing home located in Ang Mo Kio
and 23 centres located island-wide, they deliver a full
range of integrated services and programmes for
seniors including maintenance day care, day
rehabilitation, dementia care, home care, nursing
care, residential care, respite care and wellness
activities.

SLEC officially opened their first residential facility St Luke’s Residences at Ang Mo Kio (SLR@AMK) on
4 May 2020. The 189-bedded residence which spans
six levels with 12 households in total, includes a
senior care centre and day rehabilitation centre sited
within. Their residential services are designed to offer
long-term care for seniors who cannot be cared for at
home or in the community. This includes actively
engaging and providing assistance to seniors in
areas such as help with activities of daily living,
nursing care and dementia care, as well as
community, therapy, nutritional and pastoral support.

Together with the day care centre and day
rehabilitation centre, which offer physical exercises,
psychosocial engagement with volunteers and
cognitive activities, the services at SLR@AMK are
designed and tailored in accordance to the seniors'
needs.

**TOUCH Community Services**
Since 1992, TOUCH Community Services has
served children, youths, families, people with special
and healthcare needs, and seniors to see sustainable
change and transformation in their lives. The
heartbeat of TOUCH is to activate potential, build
independence, connect people, and deliver impact by
developing sustainable solutions in society. In line
with TOUCH’s vision to be a community enabler and
leveraging technology, they provide a continuum of
support for seniors in the community, such as home
care and caregiver support services, senior activity
centres, cluster support services and a senior group


The government has been making conscientious
effort in addressing the issue. In 2017, Singapore’s
two regional health systems – National Healthcare
Group and Eastern Health Alliance, will be piloting
programmes to help provide palliative care. They aim

19

to reach out to 3,000 patients over the next 5 years.

Seniors who are from the lower social economic
status have limited financial literacy. As such, there is
a need for more programmes and initiatives to help
this group of seniors stay employed and financially
secure. In addition, those that have estranged
relationships with their children may experience
setbacks applying for grants as they may have

195


home.

Their key milestones included the setting up of
TOUCHpoint@AMK 433 – Singapore’s first of its kind
activity node – in 2019, that supports ageing in
community and re-enabling of seniors. In 2017, THC
was honoured with the Best Home Care Operator
Award at the 5th Asia Pacific Eldercare Innovation
Awards for its outstanding efforts in promoting
ageing-in-place among seniors.

**KEY CHALLENGES IN SINGAPORE AGED CARE**
**SECTOR**

One of the few key challenges in Singapore’s aged
care sector is the lack of cultural openness into
issues regarding ageing and death, as it is

17

considered a cultural taboo. This will subsequently

cause a resistance towards the integration of aged
care facilities or programmes in the community. In a
2014 survey by Lien Foundation, 77% of
Singaporeans wanted to die at home, but as of 2017,
close to 70% of seniors passed away at hospitals,

18

charitable organisations or nursing homes.

difficulties in accessing documentation and
paperwork of their children’s financial status. As a
result, they may not be able to pass through the
means testing criteria for most of the grants available

20

to them.

The Singapore government has been working to
address these issues, with many different schemes in
place such as CHAS, ElderShield and the community
care vision well into 2030. It is positive that these
challenges will be addressed in the near future.

**OPPORTUNITIES IN AGEING**


To address the needs of an ageing population,
Singapore’s government has been increasing
spending on the healthcare sector. Early diagnosis
has also been a common trend amongst Singapore’s
seniors. As such, Singapore’s healthcare is expected
to grow to US$21.7 billion (S$29.8 billion) in 2020
from US$15.8 billion (S$27.3 billion) in 2019, a 9%

21

increase.

The increasing number of senior citizens is expected
to drive demand to provide sufficient living
alternatives and services. There is a huge
opportunity for operators, developers and investors to
tap into Singapore’s growing seniors living and aged
care market.

With a plethora of active ageing and ageing-in-place
policies, Singaporeans are living healthier, longer
and remaining active in the society. In addition to the
high income of the baby boomers who are part of the
ageing population and the youngest baby boomer to
join in 2024, the market opportunities to cater to their
desires and needs, in addition to the parents whom
they are supporting, are wide-ranging.


Businesses can consider tapping onto the active
ageing and preventive health management products
and services to enable seniors the options to access
the lifestyle ageing options, assistive living
technology and devices sectors.

## 6.Country Overview: Taiwan R.O.CCountry Overview: Australia

**OVERVIEW**

Based on Asian Development Bank’s latest economic
update, it is forecasted that Taiwan R.O.C (known as
“Taiwan”) will experience an economic slowdown,
where GDP growth is projected at 0.8% to US$610
billion in 2020 but is expected to recover slowly in
2021, with a forecasted GDP growth of 3.5% to

1

US$632 billion.

Taiwan’s GDP Per Capita is US$25,007 as of 2018
and is projected to increase to US$29,831 in 2025.


Taiwan has a population of over 23.8 million, with 5.4
million or 22.9% of the population aged 60 and over
as of 2020 and is projected to increase to 7.31 million

2

seniors or 30.6% of the total population.

3

Life expectancy at birth is at 80.53 years and healthy

4

life expectancy is at 67.7 years, leaving a huge gap

of about 13 years where some form of healthcare
intervention is needed – either in the form of health
management programme, assisted living services or
nursing care.

## 6.Country Overview: Taiwan R.O.CCountry Overview: Australia

Based on the ageing population chart, majority of the
seniors are between 60 to 74 years old and the age
group 70-74 remains as the largest group from 2025
onwards. In reference along with the life expectancy
and healthy life expectancy, it seems to indicate that
seniors above 75 years old may need higher medical
and aged care services as a much smaller group of
seniors live beyond 75 years old.

**INDUSTRY OUTLOOK**

Taiwan’s population structure is rapidly ageing due to
a combination of shrinking birth rates and increasing
longevity. Taiwan experienced its lowest birth rate in
eight years, for the first half of the year 2020.
According to the data from Ministry of Interior, 85,961
babies were born from January to June 2020, as
compared to 89,830 babies born in the period in

5

2019.

With a growing number of seniors and a low birth
replacement rate, there are fewer people to look after
aged family members. As such, there is an urgency
to establish a long-term care system to meet the
needs of this demographic shift.

_Data Source: PricewaterhouseCoopers[6]_


Increasingly, nursing homes are adapting to new
innovative concepts and this will drive nursing homes

10

to be viewed in a more positive light. The trend of

sending seniors to nursing care facilities will increase
with the rapidly ageing population.

As of end of 2017, the number of persons with
dementia in Taiwan has exceeded 270,000. A total of
US$306 million was invested between 2018 to 2019
to promote the prevention and care of dementia
within the ageing population.

i i


Taiwan’s long-term care spending is projected at

7

US$1.28 billion (NT$40 billion) this year. The

spending has risen gradually, and government
forecasted that long-term care costs will reach
US$2.42 billion (NT$73.6 billion) by 2026, almost
double the US$1.36 billion (NT$40 billion) projected

8

this year.

Seniors in Taiwan would prefer to age-in-place at
home, where they can spend time with their family.
Traditionally, the Asian value of filial piety has driven
the family members to care for their ageing parents.
As such, family and women play an important role in
the informal caregiving sector. However, family
structure in Taiwan has been changing. According to
the Ministry of the Interior, the percentage of single
senior households has risen from 0.39% to 9.2%
from 1976 to 2010 alone and percentage of senior

9

couple households have risen from 0.76% to 15.6%.

As such, there is a need for interventions to go
beyond the household level to be effective in caring
for these seniors. Community care models are being
developed to address the growing issue. There is an
opportunity for home care services to tap into this
growing trend.

**GOVERNMENT POLICIES & INITIATIVES**

**National Health Insurance (NHI)**
An estimated 99.6% of Taiwan’s population is
covered under the government’s NHI, a universal
healthcare scheme that aims to provide quality and
affordable medical care to every resident. To ensure
the goal is met, NHI enrolment is mandatory for all
residents in Taiwan – local and foreign alike. The
comprehensive coverage includes both inpatient and
outpatient care, prescription drugs, traditional
Chinese medicine, dental services and home nursing
care.

92% of clinics and hospitals are in affiliation with the
NHI, giving patients a variety of choice. Out-of-pocket
co-payments range from US$2.50 to US$11.50
(NT$80 to NT$360) per consultation.

According to the 2017-18 NHI Annual Report, the
public is generally pleased with the NHI, with an
85.8% satisfaction rate. Easy access to medical care
and reasonable fees ranked as the top criteria in

12

NHI’s annual Satisfaction Survey.

**Long-Term Care 1.0**
In 2006 to 2016, Taiwan has initiated a Long-Term
Care (LTC) programme, referred to as LTC 1.0. The
programme aims to provide state-subsidised care for
seniors and disabled. Coverage includes home
nursing care, meals, transportation, rehabilitation and
respite care services.

**Long-Term Care 2.0**
Launched in November 2016, Taiwan is in the
second stage of the two-decade programme. The
second stage is referred to as LTC 2.0, with an aim
to develop high-quality, affordable and universal longterm care system. This phase of the programme
expands the number community-based services from


The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW)
estimated that eligible care recipients will grow from
511,000 to 738,000 under LTC 2.0. However, this
could potentially strain funding and human capital.
From January to May 2018, 58,000 people has
applied for long-term care services, an annual
increase of more than 69% compared with the same

14

period a year ago.

**Community Care Service System**
Under LTC 2.0, a comprehensive community care
system has been constructed by the Taiwan
government. The system will have three tiers - A, B,
and C tiers - with the goal to integrate medical care,
LTC services, housing, prevention, and assistance to
ensure care recipients can access care within 30

200

i i


eight to 17. The expansion includes services such as
day care, dementia care, caregiver support, longterm care service support and small-scale
multifunction services centre.

The new policy coverage includes frail seniors over
age 65, seniors over 50 living with dementia and
people who are disabled below 49. The government
will play a huge role in subsidising the lower income
group to access these services.

Under LTC 2.0, 184 hospitals participated in the plan
for LTC discharge-friendly hospitals. A pilot for
diversified rehabilitation services was launched in
August 2018, where discharge planning services
were conducted by the hospitals. The aim is to
connect healthcare with long-term care services. This
will help seniors with their activities of daily living,
thereby reducing cost of care and family caregiver
burden. Family Caregivers Support Innovation Plans
have also been implemented in 22 cities by 2019 to

13

help with community care.

minutes in the vicinity.

Since 2019, the government has established 274 Atier facilities (Integrated Community Service
Centres), 2,922 B-tier facilities (Long-term Care
Service Institutions), and 1,603 C-tier (Grocery Store
of Care Services) facilities. However, there is a
shortage of about 50,000 beds in institutional LTC
centres. A total of US$170 million budget will be
utilised to meet this gap by 2023.

The construction of health, welfare and long-term
care facilities under the Forward-Looking
Infrastructure Project represents an amount of
US$840 million (NT$24.7 billion), with an approval

15

rate of 92.3% for 568 cases.

**Taiwan R.O.C Dementia Policy 2.0**
With an increasing number of seniors, the MOHW
advocates for dementia care services and has set up
a support centre for families of people with dementia
and patient themselves in 2017. As a part of the LTC
2.0 plan, the Dementia 2.0 plan was introduced in
June 2018. The framework used the World Health
Organisation’s action plan on public health response
to dementia as a reference to promote the following
seven strategies:

   - Prioritise dementia in public health promotion;

   - Raise public awareness and acceptance of
dementia;

   - Reduce the risk of dementia;

   - Establish a robust dementia diagnosis,
treatment, and care network;

   - Universalise support and assistance for homebased dementia caregivers;


The government has increased the number of senior
care facilities and increased funding for the aged care
sector. In 2019, 7,000 long-term care service centres
have been established around Taiwan and more than
200,000 seniors served, an increase from 80,000 in
2017. The government is looking to expand this

17

number as the ageing population grows.

As of 2012, 50% of the total medical manpower in
Taiwan is attributed to the 130,000 professional
nurses, of which 7,202 nursing professionals are
involved in providing long-term care services, 928 are
providing home-based services and 5,678 are
working at senior care institutions. The ratio of nurses

18

to seniors is 30 nurses for every 10,000 seniors.

Taiwan’s first specialised geriatric hospital and
education centre will be opened in 2022. The centre

   - Create a dementia data collection and
analysis platform; and

   - Promote dementia research, innovation, and
development.

As of May 2018, 34 day care centres will offer
dementia inclusive care services. 21 veteran homes
and welfare institutions will offer 1,012 dementia
friendly beds, while nine nursing homes and 26
public registered hospitals will provide a total of 997
beds, together with dementia services. The
resources are invested to help address the
prevalence of dementia. With the rapidly growing
ageing population, more of such facilities will be
required in the future, opening up opportunities for

16

investment in this sector.

will specialise in senior care, specialist training and
research facilities pertaining to geriatrics. The
hospital will have a capacity of 440 beds and
collaborative research will focus on pharmaceutical

The development of the geriatric facility aims to
address issues faced by the ageing population. This
will include training more geriatric doctors, research
on senior care systems and better public policy for
seniors. The hospital will form part of National Cheng

**OVERVIEW OF FACILITIES IN TAIWAN R.O.C**


In Taiwan, there are two major types of nursing
homes: hospital-based and free standing. In 2010,
there were 391 nursing homes serving the
population. These include 225 (57.5%) free-standing
nursing homes, 154 (39.4%) hospital-based nursing

20

homes, and 12 (3.1%) clinic-run nursing homes.

In 2020, there are 221 long-term care facilities and
141 nursing homes in New Taipei City alone. Home
care stood at over 2,000 care workers, with 77 home
care service providers. There were 44 day care
centres, 52 support centres for dementia and 9

21

integrated dementia centre. This number is

projected to increase substantially, to meet the
demands of an ageing population.

**Ageing Asia Curated Facilities**
**Chang Gung Dementia Centre**
Chang Gung Memorial Hospital offers the largest and
most comprehensive health care services in Taiwan,
comprised by a network of seven hospital branches
located in Linkou, Taipei, Taoyuan, Keelung, Yunlin,
Chiayi, and Kaohsiung.


The comprehensive healthcare system also consists
of Chang Gung University, Chang Gung University of
Science and Technology, Acute Hospitals, Chronic
Hospitals, and Chang Gung Nursing Home, Chang
Gung Health and Culture Village and Chang Gung
Dementia Centre.

Chang Gung Dementia Centre operates as a day
care centre that aims to engage dementia patients
through art, music, reminiscence and light therapy.
One of their programmes involves the interaction
between dementia patients with their caregivers and
educating caregivers on the progress of the disease
to enable them to progressively adapt to the
deterioration in health and behaviours of the patients.

The centre focuses on the well-being of the
caregivers as “caregivers cannot fail” while dementia
patients health and well-being deteriorate.

**Hang-An Nursing Home**
Hang-An takes the "social enterprise" approach as
the basic positioning of its operations and their focus
is on the welfare of seniors. In addition to providing
care and maintenance services for the seniors,
Hang-An uses a comprehensive service model to
provide welfare services from institutions, homes,
and communities. Hang-An aims to care for seniors
in low-income households.

As a "social enterprise", Hang-An fulfil their social
responsibilities on one hand, and on the other, they
aim for sustainability in their operations. The
business model is sufficient to provide reference for
any charity or welfare organisation that hope to
create a model based on social welfare and
efficiency.

warm care and professional services. The “ 合勤健康
共生宅” business model can help to meet the needs
of seniors’ social care. The entire planning is based
on the principle of flexibility, and with that principle in
mind, the rental of suites is operated through different
models, which can be rented daily or through longterm. This will address the needs and demands of
seniors living in the local community.

The first housing was opened in December 2019 and
they look forward to promoting a new type of housing
that will provide essential care and suit the needs of
the seniors.

Through the combined co-housing model, land
property rights can come from public or private land;
and land ownership can be jointly shared in addition
to lease. Ho Chin Health currently has three sources
of income - rental income and brand licensing income
and the reinvestment income of each operating unit
in the co-housing compound.

Taipei Medical University and Ho Chin Health
recently signed a strategic co-operation agreement
that would allow innovations such as Internet of
Things (IoT), sensors and health technology to be
introduced in the co-housing compound for regular
use.

**HonDao Senior Citizens Welfare Foundation**
Since its inception, HonDao has been actively
adapting to promote senior citizen welfare throughout
the years. Their core services for senior citizens
include:
Award for families residing within three generation building respect and care for the parents and
grandparents; Volunteer Stations and Volunteer
Services Nationwide, providing volunteer
opportunities to help seniors; Time Dollar - Mutual
Support Coupons; Hot Meal Services; Community


Care; Domestic Care Service; Senior Citizen Day
Care Service; Short-term Rehabilitation Service;
Senior Citizen Leisure Activities; and Senior Citizen
Welfare Service Consultation.

For 13 years, they have continuously provided care
and service for senior citizens. This is done through
the active assistance and resources provided by the
numerous friends of the Foundation.

At HonDao, about 4,200 seniors receive care from
about 1,600 volunteers who help to run the
organisation along with 300 staff members making it
possible for the centre to deliver on their service
promises. The average age of these volunteers are
30 years, and this can be attributed to the high
education standards in the senior care and
gerontology studies.

A unique volunteerism programme called “Time
Dollar-Mutual Support” is the other reason of the high
volunteerism. This programme implemented in 2006
leverages the concept of “paying it forward” to
encourage volunteers to offer their time in return for
assistance from the organisation in the future. Due to
its success, it is also being introduced and
implemented in some senior care centres in Taiwan.

encourages seniors to decide and select the daily
activities that they wish to do at the day centre.
RICARE emphasises on providing care services
while allowing the seniors to enjoy life. They look to


encourage seniors of all functional capability to live

professional development.

**Suang-Lien Elderly Care Centre**
Suang-Lien Elderly Centre is established by SuangLien Presbyterian Church in view of the rapidly
growing ageing population. The seniors centre was
established in 2000 for the first stage and
subsequently upgraded in 2003 and 2009.

In response to the government’s promotion of multilevel and continuous senior welfare policies, the care
centre has facilities and services such as a senior
centre, dementia senior care division, senior
community college, senior care research centre,
community caring station, home care and mission
centre.

The scenic location of the centre has views of two
mountains and a beach, providing peace and

**Sunshine Social Welfare Foundation – SUNVIS**
**Gym**
The SUNVIS Gym Centre was founded in 2018 to


help promote the concept of active ageing. It
advocates to help seniors create fun and meaning in
life, reduce disability and promote active ageing. This
will help to rebuild a sense of dignity and help seniors
remain energetic and confident.

With the concept of “rebuilding life”, professional
rehabilitation therapy teams help seniors to perform
muscle recovery and strengthening exercises. A
delicious, healthy and nutritious diet would be
recommended for the seniors. The aim of the centre
is to ultimately help seniors delay ageing related
functional decline and maintain physical fitness.

**KEY CHALLENGES IN TAIWAN R.O.C AGED**
**CARE SECTOR**

One of the key challenges facing the LTC 2.0
programme is the lack of qualified healthcare
personnel. According to MOHW, only a third of the
long-term care personnel trained annually retains
their position, whereas the remainder either retire or
change profession. In 2019, there is approximately
20,000 professional caregivers. Despite the number,
there is still a shortage of caregivers where people in
need of care would have to wait around five to ten
days. Most caregivers leave their current position due
to low salary and a lack of career progression.

The monthly salary for a caregiver is US$971, as
compared to the median income in Taiwan of
US$1,327 in 2018.

To meet the surge in ageing population, the amount
of LTC personnel must double by 2026 to prevent the
deterioration of long-term care quality. MOHW and
the Ministry of Education planned to jointly develop
long-term care courses in vocational schools and at
the university level, so as to change the notions of

205

i i

## 6.Country Overview: Taiwan R.O.CCountry Overview: Australia

care giving as a low-paying job in the country.

Although the government is helping to address these
issues, A stronger economic incentive and career
progression have to be implemented to encourage
job retention and growth of the human capital in this

22

sector.


Another key challenge would LTC being mainly taxbased funded. The main source of funding relies on
supplementary tax revenues from gift, inheritance
and cigarette taxes. The other portion would be the
funds allocated by the government budget. With a
growing ageing population, fiscal policies that look to
expand the senior industry will require bigger
budgets. Taiwan should look towards future
implementations of a long-term care being financed

23

by a public insurance scheme.

**OPPORTUNITIES IN AGEING**

As the government plans to ramp up the initiatives
and investment to increase the healthcare workforce,
the healthcare professionals should consider looking
for opportunities in the long-term care service sector.
Through active ageing concepts and integrated
models of care, healthcare professionals can expect
development through industrial collaboration across
the sectors. This will ultimately enable clear roles and

24

career pathways for such professionals.


within in the near future and given public spending
constraints, the long-term care sector and senior day
care offers opportunities for investors and operators
to explore investing into the senior care industry in
Taiwan.

Thailand is ageing faster than a lot of its peers and
will be the fastest and earliest developing country to
become an aged society. By 2035, Thailand will be
the first developing country to enter the hyper-aged

7

society.


Maintaining fiscal stability is a major concern for the
Thailand government as an upward trend is
forecasted in expenditure for the ageing population.
These are expected to be funded by tax revenues
and it will be impacted by a shrinking workforce. As a
result, there has been a focus on taking measures to
increase tax revenues. The corporate tax rate of

8

Thailand is at 20% as of 2020.

Thailand has recently introduced a stimulus package
called “Thailand Plus” for foreign investment. The
stimulus package offers investors corporate income
tax exemptions for the first 13 years and 50%
reduction for the next five. Foreign investors that
employ skilled personnel in the field of science,
technology, engineering and mathematics are also
offered tax deductions of up to 200% for training
expenses. Tax reductions of up to 200% are also

9

offered for investment in automation systems.


It was found that large number of family members did
not realise that their loved ones have Alzheimer’s
and have treated them inappropriately. It is estimated
that there are 600,000 persons with dementia in 2015
and will increase to 1.1 million and 2 million in 2030
and 2050 respectively.

The estimated cost of Dementia in 2015 is US$1.8
billion. The sharp increase in dementia patients may
imply that there is a gap in the dementia care sector
that must be addressed. Innovation in key products
and services for dementia care will be a lucrative

11

industry for Thailand in the future.

**INDUSTRY OUTLOOK**

As Thailand becoming an aged society, senior living
community development is a potential growth area
for Thailand. To cater to the increasing number in the
ageing population, more senior housing projects by
both government bodies and private developers are
rising across the country.


Thailand is also focusing on developing a tax system
that not only boosts revenue, but also reduces
healthcare spending by encouraging healthier
lifestyles. This include the policy introduction of sugar
taxes and reduction of salt intake per capita. There
would be an emerging market for health food and

10

nutrition in Thailand.

The number of patients with Alzheimer’s disease in
Thailand is increasing every year. Research has
shown that 5% of seniors aged 65 years and above
have Alzheimer’s disease, with this number
increasing to 20% in those older than 80.


Currently there are few active senior living facilities
for seniors who are in the middle to upper end of the
market. The reason is believed to be due to Thai
culture where most Thai seniors prefer to live with
their families. However, this may change due to
decreasing birth rates and increasing number of baby
boomers lean towards the ideal of senior living
facilities with senior housing estates emphasising on

12

the quality of services for assisted living.

The low birth rate and children’s migration to urban
centres in search for work will possibility result in
Thai families becoming more open and comfortable
with the option to send their aged members that lose
the ability to live independently to better-equipped
senior homes. According to research, more affluent

Thai baby boomers are planning for active ageing
without relying on assistance from their family

13

members on retirement.

While most of the senior housing projects are aimed
at accommodating ageing Thai population, the
country is seeing a strong potential for the luxury
senior housing developments especially in the
country's resort destinations such as such as Phuket,
Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, and Hua Hin, catering
mainly to foreign retirees and affluent Thais.


Thailand is branded as one of the best in Asia Pacific
for retirement. As a result, the country has been
receiving an influx of foreign retirees choosing to
spend their retirement years in luxury yet affordable
luxurious senior housing developments. These
factors could translate into future demand for senior
homes. Although currently, the luxury senior housing
market in Thailand remains relatively small but it has

14

a strong potential to grow.

The increasing number of persons with dementia and
Alzheimer’s disease also motivate more initiatives on
active ageing as well as focus on dementia and
Alzheimer’s disease in senior living facilities.
Although senior living facilities are on the rise, many
still uses home-based services for convenience and
removal of the need to travel.

**GOVERNMENT POLICIES & INITIATIVES**

Thailand is ageing more rapidly than other major
emerging Asian countries, and its rising financial and
healthcare needs of seniors pose a serious challenge
to its policymakers. It is reported that by 2050,
Thailand is forecast to become a "super-aged"
society, with seniors accounting for more than 35% of

15

the population.


**Community care policy**
To tackle the issue, the Thailand government in 2011
rolled out a new community care policy as a part of a
project in the district of Lam Sonthi, in Lopburi
Province. Additionally, funding of US$7.4 million was
created by the National Health Security Office
(NHSO) for long-term care (LTC) facilities for seniors.
In the fiscal year 2016, a trial programme announced
by the government spread across 1,000 sub-districts,

16

including 100,000 severely disabled individuals.

**Long-Term Care Project launched in 2016**
The LTC project focused on assigning caregivers to
every senior. Each caregiver takes care of between 1
and 10 senior people in their community. The LTC
project covers various services including functional
training, psychological support, vital checks, personal
hygiene care, environmental checks, daily-living
assistance, oral-health checks, nutritional care and

17

Thai traditional massages.


**New Labour Protection Act (No. 6), B.E. 2560**
**(2017)**
The law was published in the Government Gazette
on 31 August 2017, and came into effect on 1
September 2017, amending the previous Act. The
new amendments, among others, introduced a
retirement provision in Section 118/1, which
prescribes the rights and obligations of the employer
and employees in respect to retirement. In addition to
ensuring that retiring employees have the right to
receive statutory severance pay upon retirement, the
provision also provides employees, who are 60 years
old or more, the right to choose to retire with full

18

severance pay.

1. Retirement is deemed to be termination of
employment, and the retiring employees are
entitled to severance pay under Section 118.

retirement is set at more than 60 years of age,
those employees who are 60 years of age or
more, may inform the employers of their
intention to retire. It is not compulsory, but
optional, for those employees who are 60
years of age or more to exercise this right of
retirement.

**DEVELOPMENT OF ELDERCARE SERVICES &**
**SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES**

With Thailand set to become a super-aged/hyperaged society in the coming years, situation will drive
the demand for residential complexes with integrated
healthcare solutions.

In recent years, residential developers have been
tapping into this market to develop retirement homes
with senior care services. Examples are Magnolia
Quality Development Corporation (MQDC) and SC
Asset Corporation PCL. These retirement homes
also have a market for foreigners with aims of
developers to sell 20% of their projects to overseas
buyers.

The number of foreigners over 50 who have applied
for retirement visas to stay in Thailand almost
doubled to nearly 73,000 in 2017 from fewer than
40,000 in 2013, according to immigration bureau

20

data.

Thonburi Healthcare Group (THG) has also jumped
on the bandwagon to develop an assisted living
development to help meet demands of the country’s
aged population. Along with this project, they have
also developed Thailand’s first hospital dedicated to
comprehensive senior care focusing on rehabilitation
and specialising in care for Alzheimer’s and stroke
patients

To date, there are about 800 senior care facilities in
Thailand with almost two-thirds of them run by

individuals and the rest by juristic entities. However,
Thailand is facing a shortage of skilled healthcare
workers to run these facilities and meet the demand
for senior care.

Complaints have arisen about inadequate care and
inability to handle deaths of seniors. The government
department in charge of this has stepped in to share
knowledge about standard senior care with the

21

affected facilities.

According to the National Statistical Office, the
proportion of senior citizens living alone soared from
8% in 2014 to 10.8% in 2017. In this group, the
number of women was greater than that of men. If
they do not prepare for their later years from an early
age, they will be economically disadvantaged. In
order to obtain healthcare or senior care services,

they may also require caregivers which will drive up
their cost or deter them from reaching out to receive

22

the needed healthcare/senior care services.

**OVERVIEW OF FACILITIES IN THAILAND**

As of 2018, there is close to 950,000 dependent
seniors, of which 143,000 of them are bedridden. The
average monthly fee to stay in a nursing home is
approximately US$484 ~ US$968 (15,000 to 30,000
Thai Baht).

The senior care sector in Thailand is relatively
fragmented, with 800 private nursing homes and 30
state-owned nursing homes. Of these 800 private
nursing homes, 95% of them are small players and
there is no real market leader.

**KEY CHALLENGES IN THAILAND AGED CARE**
**SECTOR**


One of the challenges faced in providing aged care
services is the shortage of skilled healthcare workers
to run these facilities and meet the demand for senior
care, which resulted in complaints about inadequate
care provided or the inability to handle deaths
amongst seniors. The government department in
charge of this has stepped in to share knowledge
about standard senior care with the affected

24

facilities.


There is an increasing number of senior citizens who
live alone as their children relocate to the cities for
work. According to the National Statistical Office, the
proportion of senior citizens living alone soared from
8% in 2014 to 10.8% in 2017, and in most cases, the
number of women is higher than of the men.

These seniors need to prepare financially from early
age for their retirement years, otherwise, they may be
severely disadvantage with the rising cost of
healthcare and aged care.

Between 2015 and 2018, the poverty rate in Thailand
increased from 7.2% to 9.8%, and the absolute
number of people living in poverty rose from 4.85
million to more than 6.7 million. The increase in
poverty in 2018 was widespread - occurring in all
regions and in 61 out of 77 provinces. In the Central
and Northeast, the number of poor increased by over
half a million in each region during the same period.

The conflict-affected South became the region with
the highest poverty rate for the first time in 2017. This
is a result of a stall in growth of household income
and consumption growth. This group of the
population will face challenges in accessing
healthcare and aged care. With rising costs, they will
either go untreated or will not receive adequate

25

treatment.

**OPPORTUNITIES IN AGEING**

There are numerous opportunities for investment
within multiple business sectors across the silver
market due to Thailand’s ageing population.
The increasing life expectancy within the population
is a result of better-informed health choices,
improving technology and rapidly improving health
services. With longer life expectancies and smaller

family sizes, the country will be expecting to become
a super aged society by 2030, with 27% or 19 million
of the population aged above 60.

The growing population of seniors will be projected to
live longer with increasing consumption patterns not
just in the healthcare sector, but also across various
industries that include - technology, mobility,
entertainment, tourism and real estate and housing

26

sectors.

In addition to the ageing population, Thailand
remains as one of the favourite destinations for
foreign retirees. The premium senior housing sector
remains an attractive sector for developers to
consider targeting foreign retirees.

**INDUSTRY OUTLOOK**

In Vietnam, family members, particularly women,
have been the de facto caregivers for the seniors.
However, as the family structure evolves and the
needs of seniors become increasingly complex, there
is an imperative for interventions to go beyond the
household level to be effective.

It will take time for a paradigm shift in the mindset of
the Vietnamese community to view registering
seniors into a nursing home or geriatric hospital as a
taboo or failure to perform filial duties. However, the
trend of sending seniors to nursing care facilities will
grow due to the rapidly ageing population.

To facilitate the transition to a new aged care model,
the country needs to address major structural
bottlenecks including, limited access to essential
medical and social care services as well as weak

in the various provinces could have been set up.

Currently, throughout the country, only 49 out of 69
city-level and provincial-level hospitals have
gerontology faculties, and only three institutes offer

With the rise of living standards of the population in
cities in recent years, private care centres for seniors
or geriatric nursing homes have been established.
These private organisations generally take care of

Geriatric healthcare has started to receive attention

was no planning for such facilities, and thus cannot
be implemented. It is not entirely clear which
government agency is responsible for developing

9

nursing home planning.

The private sector participated in providing care for
seniors mostly by having care services in nursing
centres and home-based care. The private care
centres are usually concentrated in big cities. This
model provides more service options for seniors and
their families such as day-care, home-based care,

10

and in-patient care.


According to a survey conducted in 2017 on the living
quality of seniors in private nursing homes carried out
in Vietnam's southern economic hub of Ho Chi Minh
City, as many as 84.8% of those surveyed said they
are satisfied with the health care services. Up to
79.5% of them said they felt satisfied with the care
they were receiving from the staff and with the new

11

friendships they had made at the centres.

**GOVERNMENT POLICIES & INITIATIVES**

Ageing issues have been considered a priority in
Vietnam’s Socio-Economic Development Strategy
(2011-2020), as well as the Socio-Economic
Development Plan, 2016-2020. The Strategy
referenced to the need to provide healthcare for
seniors while within the Plan’s primary objectives and
solutions, more attention would be given to family
issues, healthcare for seniors.

Furthermore, issues facing seniors have been
addressed in several of the sectoral strategies. The
National Strategy of Social Security (2011-2020)
underlines the needs of building up comprehensive
social security mechanisms, health care and social
assistance for seniors to better address their
economic, social risks and health.

The Strategy of Population and Reproductive Health
(2011-2020) focuses on some priorities, including
strengthening senior primary health care system.

The Strategy for Family Development (2020 – vision
2030) focuses on strengthening inter-family
relationships, household economy development,
family database, family research and assessment,
which includes attention to seniors related matters in
the family.

At the end of 2017, the Prime Minister signed
Resolution No 137 promulgating the Government’s
‘Program of Action on Population’. This Resolution
provides guidelines on putting in place a network for
improving the quality of population services. It
identifies the responsibility of each Ministry and
highlights the ageing-related issues that each
Ministry would need to address.

These issues include health care; encouraging


According to the plan, authorities at all levels will
need to make sure that 100% of seniors have health
insurance cards by 2025, and that 80% receive at
least one medical check-up a year and maintain up

Health in December 2016, aims to improve health
outcomes for seniors in the 2017-2025 period.

One of the action plan’s targets is that 80% of seniors
are able to care for themselves. By providing them
with necessary basic knowledge and practices will
help to alleviate crowding in hospitals.

The General Office for Population and Family
Planning is tasked with overseeing the
implementation of the action plan in the country.

**DEVELOPMENT OF ELDERCARE SERVICES &**
**SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES**

With an ageing population, comes an increasing
need for infrastructure and resources catering to
seniors healthcare. This means that there will be a
need for more facilities, such as day care and
geriatric wards in current hospitals; an increase need
for geriatric specialist, and caregivers specialising in
aged care.

According to the Department of Social Protection
under MOLISA, the number of centres of different
types in the country is more than 400. Following that,
there are 13 centres of social care and care for
seniors with 443 staffs (34 staff/ 1 facility) and
nursing care for 4,723 seniors (363 subjects/ 1
institution). There are eight public and five non-public
facilities distributed in four regions: three (3) in Red
River Delta; one (1) in North Central, seven (7) in
South East, and two (2) in Mekong Delta.

Existing nursing home care is either private sector
funded, publicly funded or supported by charities.
Vietnam currently has 31 nursing homes and aims to
have 64 more, 59 of them run by the private sector.
While nursing care for the seniors has the potential to
grow, government financial support has been limited,
delaying private sector investment.

The trend of sending seniors to nursing care facilities
will continue to grow due to a rapidly ageing
population. The Government is working toward
having at least one facility in each province by

15

2025.


**OVERVIEW OF FACILITIES IN VIETNAM**

In 2017, there were 427 institutions for care of
seniors, people with disability and orphans. Of these,
there were around 20 private homes (mostly in big
cities), which provided care for seniors with very high
out-of-pocket payment of around US$400-1,000 per
month.

Only lonely seniors having no family can be admitted
to public social institution funded by government.
Some pagodas and churches also provide support for
a limited number of lonely seniors. Private nursing
homes for seniors are expanding very slowly, as
there are no incentives given for setting these up in
the form of tax concessions or loans for construction.
In 2017, of 11million seniors nationwide, an
estimated of over 10,000 of them were staying in
public and private care centres.

Hence, it was renamed to Thanh Loc Nurturing
Center.

The centre completed its revamp in 2014 and is built

of disadvantaged people with chronic illnesses who
are not able to take care of themselves. The centre
has a motto of "Caring for the subjects like caring for
their family members". The goal is for seniors to have
a peace of mind and trust that they are being well
cared for when living here.

**Key challenges in Vietnam Aged Care Sector**

In Vietnam, 80% of seniors live with their children.
Caring for seniors is mainly the responsibility of the
family who may lack the knowledge of health care for
their seniors. 70% of seniors live with little savings or
pension, especially in rural areas.

## 6.Country Overview: VietnamCountry Overview: Australia

A long term solution to the issue could involve
improving the health quality of seniors and
encouraging economic activities suitable to their skills
and physical capabilities.

By improving senior healthcare and encouraging
savings for retirement from a young age, the future
seniors will be able to live more independently. This
will help them to enjoy healthier and more joyful
lifestyles as they get old and relieve the burden on
the society to take care of them.

However, Vietnam does not have the funds for an
expensive ‘action plan’, and Vietnam’s institutional
network is not yet sufficient to drive bottom-up
change. Bottom-up change is only possible if there
are enough community organisations, services,
volunteer centres and senior research centres for
seniors to participate based on their willingness and
interest. Unfortunately, such institutional networks
are still underdeveloped in Vietnam due to the longstanding cultural ideology that children should take
care of their parents in their retirement.

Dealing with Vietnam’s ageing population is both a
public policy challenge and a cultural challenge.
It will take some time for the Vietnamese government
to implement long-term and bottom-up solutions to
improve labour productivity and services for seniors.
In the meantime, raising the retirement age and
increasing the birth rate are considered more viable

17

solutions by Vietnamese policymakers.

Another challenge is in the health service provision at
PHC level. There is a shortage and low quality of
health workforces at grassroot level in providing PHC
services, lack of medicines and medical equipment
compared to regulation. The budget allocation is in
favour of tertiary hospitals and under-funded for
PHC.


The Vietnamese baby boomers are one of the first
brand-conscious consumers in Vietnam. They tend to
spend lavishly to ensure a comfortable life for their
families. These include growing trends such as
spending on lifestyle consumer products, material

20

wealth and travel.

With a relatively strong economy and a GDP that is
projected to rebound from 2021, along with an ageing
population with growing needs, Vietnam has a need
that has yet been addressed for the ageing market.

Vietnam, as an emerging market holds substantial
opportunities growth for investors, operators and the
likes.

226

i i


Although there is a wide health service delivery
network, there seems to be a lack of integration in
providing preventive and curative services, between

18

health programmes.

The healthcare sectors should enhance the
investment, improve the primary health care,
integrate the medical care with social care; heed
close attention on health care and nutrition for
seniors.

It is necessary to develop more nursing home models
that are suitable with traditional culture of the
Vietnamese. It is also important to develop a longterm care policy system and integrate it with other
policies. There should be a policy to encourage the
private sector to invest in the long-term care facilities,
including the community-based long-term care
facilities such as land support and tax exemption.

## Appendix: Ageing Asia Silver Economy Index


This section details the statistical data used for the
tabulate and generate the Ageing Asia Silver
Economy Index 2020. Based on the data compiled
from World Bank - World Development Data,
International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) – World
Economic Outlook Update, June 2020 with a recent
forecast on GDP for 2019 – 2021.

The methodology that was used in the Ageing Asia
Silver Economy Index 2015 was refined further with
some changes to the parameters and weightage for
certain parameters. The key drivers of the index
remain the same with the key focus on

   - Market size of the ageing population – the
number of seniors within a market is one of
the key market entrant determinants. The
market size plays a bigger role in the
consideration, as compared to the percentage
of an ageing population within a country. In
view of this, we have increased the weightage
for market size and reduced the ageing
population percentage, while maintaining the
ageing population weightage at 15%

   - Financial Capacity – the wealth of the
residents and the capacity to purchase and
consume other products and services outside
of household consumption expenditure, either
by the senior themselves or by their children.

   - Life Expectancy – this factor remains as the
one of key determinants in the longevity of a
demand for goods and services. We have
removed the poor health expectancy metric,
making life expectancy as the single factor in
this category.

   - Retirement funds – in relation to income and
savings, we have added in mandatory


retirement savings and government healthcare
support as a new indicator of the retirement
living financial burden.

Based on our research, we found that for some
countries, seniors face financial crunch due to poor
saving planning and high healthcare costs. In view of
this, we have added in retirement living financial
burden indicator based on two key factors, namely
mandatory retirement saving plan implemented within
each country (minimum 35 years of savings) and the
level of healthcare financial support provided by the
government for seniors.

The indicator is based on a combination of these
factors with a range of one to five points:

1. Extensive government healthcare financial
support and more than or equal to 35 years
of mandatory retirement savings plan.

2. Extensive government healthcare financial
support and has less than 35 years of
mandatory retirement savings plan.

3. Minimum government healthcare financial
support and has more or equal to 35 years of
mandatory retirement savings plan.

4. Minimum or no government healthcare
financial support and has less than 35 years
of mandatory retirement savings plan.

5. Minimum or no government healthcare
financial support and no mandatory
retirement savings plan.

The following assumptions were established in the
development of the Index, in view of the limited
secondary data for projection of market potentials:
